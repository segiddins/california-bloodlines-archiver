Lightening strikes in the summertime
One Eyed Joe was a friend of mine
Now he's gone, moving down the line
One Eyed Joe yeah, well he's on the borderline

Sideways Sally was his girlfriend's name
She could dance like a monkey train
Now she's gone, she's moving down the line
Sideways Sally yeah, she's on the borderline

One Eyed Joe, he's a wanted man
He can fly down to Birmingham
Now he's gone, he is on the borderline
One Eyed Joe, he's moving down the line 

Sideways Sally, One Eyed Joe
Living out in a blue condo
Now they're gone, moving down the line
Sideways Sally, One Eyed Joe
Well, they're on the borderline
One Eyed Joe yeah, he is on the borderline
