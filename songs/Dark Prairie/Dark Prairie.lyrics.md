This old earth, she treats me like a stranger
This old earth, she don't even care
This old earth, she tortures me with seasons
This old earth, ain't going anywhere

Wake up in the morning and I'm hungry
Wake up in the evening and I'm cold
Mama's in her bed with a fever
This old earth will see she don't get old

Dark prairie skies, hide the far horizon
Dark prairie wind, blowing down our home
Dark prairie eyes, watch us through the window
Dark prairie, buries her own

I hate to see my woman looking hollow
I hate to see my woman's eyes grow dim
I ease her all I can, as the sweat upon my hand
Mingles with the earth upon her chin

Dark prairie skies, hide the far horizon
Dark prairie wind, blowing down our home
Dark prairie eyes, watch us through the window
Dark prairie, buries her own

Dark prairie skies, hide the far horizon
Dark prairie wind, blowing down our home
Dark prairie eyes, watch us through the window
Dark prairie, buries her own
