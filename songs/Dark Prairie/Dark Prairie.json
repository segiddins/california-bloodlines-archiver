    "Lyrics": "This old earth, she treats me like a stranger\nThis old earth, she don't even care\nThis old earth, she tortures me with seasons\nThis old earth, ain't going anywhere\n\nWake up in the morning and I'm hungry\nWake up in the evening and I'm cold\nMama's in her bed with a fever\nThis old earth will see she don't get old\n\nDark prairie skies, hide the far horizon\nDark prairie wind, blowing down our home\nDark prairie eyes, watch us through the window\nDark prairie, buries her own\n\nI hate to see my woman looking hollow\nI hate to see my woman's eyes grow dim\nI ease her all I can, as the sweat upon my hand\nMingles with the earth upon her chin\n\nDark prairie skies, hide the far horizon\nDark prairie wind, blowing down our home\nDark prairie eyes, watch us through the window\nDark prairie, buries her own\n\nDark prairie skies, hide the far horizon\nDark prairie wind, blowing down our home\nDark prairie eyes, watch us through the window\nDark prairie, buries her own\n\n",
