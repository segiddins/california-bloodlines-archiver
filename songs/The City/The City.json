    "Lyrics": "Oh, in the city, oh, in the city\nOh, living in the city\n\nOh, it's so easy to be lost in the city\nEvery corner I have crossed in the city\nSomeone there is paying the cost of the city\nOh, it's so easy to be lost in the city\n\nIt's so easy to be down in the city\n'Cause every time you turn around in the city\nThere's the smell, there's the sounds of the city\nOh, it's so easy to be down, living in the city\n\nIn the city, living in the city\nLiving in the city, in the city\n\nEverybody wants a home in the city\nEverybody feels alone in the city\nMary Lou's, that's my home in New York City\n'Cause everybody wants a home in the city\n\nIn the city, living in the city\nIn the city, in the city\n\nHere I stand on the edge of the city\nThere's people out there on the ledge in the city\nI don't care, that's the way of the city\nI just stand here on the edge of the city\n\nOf the city, L.A.'s a city, they're all the same \nNew York City, like a midnight train\nDetroit City, in the wind and the rain\nD.C. City, oh it's all the same\nLiving in the city\n\nCrosstown City, Rundown City\nLiving in the city\nLiving in the city\nLiving in the city\n\n\n",
