Oh, in the city, oh, in the city
Oh, living in the city

Oh, it's so easy to be lost in the city
Every corner I have crossed in the city
Someone there is paying the cost of the city
Oh, it's so easy to be lost in the city

It's so easy to be down in the city
'Cause every time you turn around in the city
There's the smell, there's the sounds of the city
Oh, it's so easy to be down, living in the city

In the city, living in the city
Living in the city, in the city

Everybody wants a home in the city
Everybody feels alone in the city
Mary Lou's, that's my home in New York City
'Cause everybody wants a home in the city

In the city, living in the city
In the city, in the city

Here I stand on the edge of the city
There's people out there on the ledge in the city
I don't care, that's the way of the city
I just stand here on the edge of the city

Of the city, L.A.'s a city, they're all the same 
New York City, like a midnight train
Detroit City, in the wind and the rain
D.C. City, oh it's all the same
Living in the city

Crosstown City, Rundown City
Living in the city
Living in the city
Living in the city
