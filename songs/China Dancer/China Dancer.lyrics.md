Johnny Echo is a soldier, got a Sony in his hand
And he puts it on his shoulder, finds the action if he can
Yeah, Johnny caught the dancer, yeah, he shot her in the sun
Yeah, Johnny has the answer, use a camera not a gun
Use a camera not a gun
Use a camera not a gun

And he said you are the revolution
Said you are the revolution
Said have you got the answer
Ooooh, China dancer

Johnny's on the front lines, dancer's on the wire
Johnny caught the headline, dancer caught the fire
Oh, he met her up in Berlin or was it Mandolay 
He said baby where have you been, gonna beam you up today
Gonna beam you up today
Gonna beam you up today

And he said you are the revolution
Said you are the revolution
Said have you got the answer
Ooooh, China dancer

Then you shoot 'em in the plaza and you shoot 'em on the wall
Shoot 'em on the singles, there ain't no light at all
You shoot 'em by the torches and you shoot 'em being free
You shoot 'em to the satellite so everyone can see
China Dancer

Freedom is a dancer just trying to get the light
Johnny has the answer, gonna beam you up tonight
Gonna beam you up tonight
Gonna beam you up tonight

And he said you are the revolution
Said you are the revolution
Said you have the answer
Ooooh, China dancer
China Dancer
China Dancer
China Dancer
