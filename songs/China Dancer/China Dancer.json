    "Lyrics": "Johnny Echo is a soldier, got a Sony in his hand\nAnd he puts it on his shoulder, finds the action if he can\nYeah, Johnny caught the dancer, yeah, he shot her in the sun\nYeah, Johnny has the answer, use a camera not a gun\nUse a camera not a gun\nUse a camera not a gun\n\nAnd he said you are the revolution\nSaid you are the revolution\nSaid have you got the answer\nOoooh, China dancer\n\nJohnny's on the front lines, dancer's on the wire\nJohnny caught the headline, dancer caught the fire\nOh, he met her up in Berlin or was it Mandolay \nHe said baby where have you been, gonna beam you up today\nGonna beam you up today\nGonna beam you up today\n\nAnd he said you are the revolution\nSaid you are the revolution\nSaid have you got the answer\nOoooh, China dancer\n\nThen you shoot 'em in the plaza and you shoot 'em on the wall\nShoot 'em on the singles, there ain't no light at all\nYou shoot 'em by the torches and you shoot 'em being free\nYou shoot 'em to the satellite so everyone can see\nChina Dancer\n\nFreedom is a dancer just trying to get the light\nJohnny has the answer, gonna beam you up tonight\nGonna beam you up tonight\nGonna beam you up tonight\n\nAnd he said you are the revolution\nSaid you are the revolution\nSaid you have the answer\nOoooh, China dancer\nChina Dancer\nChina Dancer\nChina Dancer\n\n",
