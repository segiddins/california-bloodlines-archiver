It's Blaze and Diego on the Tucson road
Rocket Roy in the real world

Hot wind and forbidden hair, top down weather, roadside flares
While eyes on the reservation watch the sky
As black asphalt ribbons cut across sacred ground, across sacred lives
And sad-eyed young braves stumble and fall
And remember one bright Angel in the window of the Christmas store
At the Fashion Square Mall

Hot air balloons, flagship down, the speed of sidewinders, hot desert towns
Supermarkets, fireworks stands, steel machines, rock and roll bands
Radio carcasses, vulcanized road kill from an eighteen wheeler's speed
Budweiser billboards for Budweiser breeds, Blaze and Diego and Alamo wheels
Police tapes and Pepsi's and Circle K meals, yards off the highway
Reservation jams on well worn telecasters and hard weathered hands
Dead drunk in the tail bed of some pickup Dodge
Lucky Strike traders, the sweat of the lodge
As sad eyed young braves stumble and fall
And remember one bright Angel in the window of the Christmas store
In the Fashion Square Mall

Blaze and Diego, strawberry dreams
Nightline and ready whip and pre-faded jeans
And Rocket Roy in the real world, life on the run
Blaze and Diego, way too much fun
While the Apache Nation, Hopee, Navajo and Mojave 
Radio Shack stereo's, Amigo, Keemosabie
Turquoise bracelets and beaded belts
Medicine bundles and lion skin quivers
Mesquitewood war clubs, calendar sticks, 
Eagle feathers on short rods, Shaman's tablets
Cocoons strung on cords, White man's schools
Corrupt chiefs, suicide races
As sad eyed young braves remember one bright Angel in the window of the
Christmas store 
At the Fashion Square Mall

It's Rocket Roy in the real world, 
Blaze and Diego suck down crystal water bottles
And dream of one bright Angel in the window of the Christmas store
In the Fashion Square Mall
