    "Lyrics": "It's Blaze and Diego on the Tucson road\nRocket Roy in the real world\n\nHot wind and forbidden hair, top down weather, roadside flares\nWhile eyes on the reservation watch the sky\nAs black asphalt ribbons cut across sacred ground, across sacred lives\nAnd sad-eyed young braves stumble and fall\nAnd remember one bright Angel in the window of the Christmas store\nAt the Fashion Square Mall\n\nHot air balloons, flagship down, the speed of sidewinders, hot desert towns\nSupermarkets, fireworks stands, steel machines, rock and roll bands\nRadio carcasses, vulcanized road kill from an eighteen wheeler's speed\nBudweiser billboards for Budweiser breeds, Blaze and Diego and Alamo wheels\nPolice tapes and Pepsi's and Circle K meals, yards off the highway\nReservation jams on well worn telecasters and hard weathered hands\nDead drunk in the tail bed of some pickup Dodge\nLucky Strike traders, the sweat of the lodge\nAs sad eyed young braves stumble and fall\nAnd remember one bright Angel in the window of the Christmas store\nIn the Fashion Square Mall\n\nBlaze and Diego, strawberry dreams\nNightline and ready whip and pre-faded jeans\nAnd Rocket Roy in the real world, life on the run\nBlaze and Diego, way too much fun\nWhile the Apache Nation, Hopee, Navajo and Mojave \nRadio Shack stereo's, Amigo, Keemosabie\nTurquoise bracelets and beaded belts\nMedicine bundles and lion skin quivers\nMesquitewood war clubs, calendar sticks, \nEagle feathers on short rods, Shaman's tablets\nCocoons strung on cords, White man's schools\nCorrupt chiefs, suicide races\nAs sad eyed young braves remember one bright Angel in the window of the\nChristmas store \nAt the Fashion Square Mall\n\nIt's Rocket Roy in the real world, \nBlaze and Diego suck down crystal water bottles\nAnd dream of one bright Angel in the window of the Christmas store\nIn the Fashion Square Mall\n\n",
