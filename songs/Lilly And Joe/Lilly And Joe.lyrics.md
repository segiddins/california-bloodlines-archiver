Oh, I believe she believed
That we'd all live forever
Both of us together
Lilly and Joe
Oh, I believe she believed
That we'd all live forever
Both of us together
Lilly and Joe

Lilly would paint on the walls of her room
Pictures of the sun using always blue
She said it was because the sun must be so lonely
With no one there to share such a never ending view

Oh, I believe she believed
That we'd all live forever
Both of us together
Lilly and Joe
Oh, I believe she believed
That we'd all live forever
Both of us together
Lilly and Joe

Hitchhike any road, who do you find?
Orphans on the run, they were her kind
Poets and hobos, Hershey's and wine
Lilly she was loved and forgotten by time

Oh, I believe she believed
That we'd all live forever
Both of us together
Lilly and Joe
Oh, I believe she believed
That we'd all live forever
Both of us together
Lilly and Joe

Oh, I believe she believed
That we'd all live forever
Both of us together
Lilly and Joe
Oh, I believe she believed
That we'd all live forever
Both of us together
Lilly and Joe
