I don't want to hear your stories of old
Don't show me your golden chains
For if there's just one man in this whole wide land
And he is living in pain
Oh, then freedom's not your name

You told me of a dream that I would surely like to see
Where each man could keep the wolves from his door
But, then I saw an old man without a dollar in his hand
Saying, "You don't need me anymore
I guess you just don't need me anymore"

I don't want to hear your stories of old
Don't show me your golden chains
For if there's just one man in this whole wide land
And he is living in pain
Oh, then freedom's not your name

We've got a lot of pride and that I can't deny
From those who bore us liberty
But, if freedom's at the door and we let it wait some more
Oh, I wonder how proud they are of me?
I wonder just how proud they are of me?

Go ahead and walk away
Yeah, turn your back and say,
"We'll show 'em who's got who on the run"
But, if we could talk with folks out there
We might get somewhere
And maybe someday we could throw away these guns
Someday we could throw away these guns

I don't want to hear your stories of old
Don't show me your golden chains
For if there's just one man in this whole wide land
And he is living in pain
Oh, then freedom's not your name

If there's just one man in this whole wide land
And he is living in pain
Oh, then freedom's not your name
