    "Lyrics": "Railroad tracks and hearts of sorrow, searchlights dreams in the neon sky\nStraight edged razors and the long stemmed roses\nBlue eyed girls and the Roosevelt dimes\nWhite man's churches and Waring Blenders\nRefrigerator magnets and vacant smiles\nMovie star shoes and ice cream glasses, talking clocks and slaves of\nstyle\nAnd we're living in a hopeless utopia, we're living in a hopeless utopia\nWe're living in a hopeless utopia, hopeless utopia\n\nFootball jersey's and Formica dinners, Lucille Ball and tennis shoes\nBright young midgets and the silver liners, forever amber and baby blues\nPerfect dreams and cool veranda's, jukebox baby’s dreams of Dan\nPermanent waves and the red bandana's, diamond rings on the tattooed\nhands\nWe're living in a hopeless utopia, we're living in a hopeless utopia\nWe're living in a hopeless utopia, hopeless utopia\n\nMothers rocking plastic babies, speaking dogs and silent screams\nThere is magic in the lesser children, there is wisdom in the mad man's\ndreams\nSoda fountains and the smell on jasmine, Betty Grable and cowboy jeans\nResurrection in the face of failure, protection for the fallen queen\nAnd we're living in a hopeless utopia, we're living in a hopeless utopia\nWe're living in a hopeless utopia, hopeless utopia\n\nThe virgins in the Waco ashes, darker angels are about\nAA guys and acid flashes, camels backs and straws of doubt\nTV wars and bright Nintendo's, white bread smile, telling lies\nGodless schools and steel crescendo's, the fall from grace was no\nsurprise\nSalvation lives in our own eyes, \nFor we're living in a hopeless utopia, we're living in a hopeless utopia\nWe're living in a hopeless utopia, hopeless utopia\n\nHopeless utopia\n\n",
