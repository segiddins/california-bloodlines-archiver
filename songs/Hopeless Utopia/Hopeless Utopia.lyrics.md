Railroad tracks and hearts of sorrow, searchlights dreams in the neon sky
Straight edged razors and the long stemmed roses
Blue eyed girls and the Roosevelt dimes
White man's churches and Waring Blenders
Refrigerator magnets and vacant smiles
Movie star shoes and ice cream glasses, talking clocks and slaves of
style
And we're living in a hopeless utopia, we're living in a hopeless utopia
We're living in a hopeless utopia, hopeless utopia

Football jersey's and Formica dinners, Lucille Ball and tennis shoes
Bright young midgets and the silver liners, forever amber and baby blues
Perfect dreams and cool veranda's, jukebox babyâ€™s dreams of Dan
Permanent waves and the red bandana's, diamond rings on the tattooed
hands
We're living in a hopeless utopia, we're living in a hopeless utopia
We're living in a hopeless utopia, hopeless utopia

Mothers rocking plastic babies, speaking dogs and silent screams
There is magic in the lesser children, there is wisdom in the mad man's
dreams
Soda fountains and the smell on jasmine, Betty Grable and cowboy jeans
Resurrection in the face of failure, protection for the fallen queen
And we're living in a hopeless utopia, we're living in a hopeless utopia
We're living in a hopeless utopia, hopeless utopia

The virgins in the Waco ashes, darker angels are about
AA guys and acid flashes, camels backs and straws of doubt
TV wars and bright Nintendo's, white bread smile, telling lies
Godless schools and steel crescendo's, the fall from grace was no
surprise
Salvation lives in our own eyes, 
For we're living in a hopeless utopia, we're living in a hopeless utopia
We're living in a hopeless utopia, hopeless utopia

Hopeless utopia
