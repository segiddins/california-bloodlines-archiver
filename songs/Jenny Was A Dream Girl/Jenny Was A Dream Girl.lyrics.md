Jenny when you find the sun, dream girls do
Jenny when you're on the run, it's dream girl do
Running with the boys when the boys said go
You had them out on the line
And they danced all night to the song you sang
Jenny was a dream girl down the line

Jenny you're before the fall, dream girls do
Jenny when you hit the wall and your dreams fall through
Don't look lost in your lover boy's eyes
You're gonna see it's true
That nothing is free and the heart you break
Jenny, like a dream, comes back to you

Jenny was a dream girl
Jenny was a dream girl 
Jenny was a dream girl down the line

Running with the boys when the boys said go
You had them out on the line
And they danced all night to the songs you sang
Jenny was a dream girl down the line

Jenny was a dream girl
Jenny was a dream girl 
Jenny was a dream girl down the line

Jenny was a dream girl
Jenny was a dream girl 
Jenny was a dream girl down the line
