Ah, wheatfield lady, in the wheatfield we were young
Ah, my wheatfield lady, I can taste you on my tongue
And leaving out before me, the endless highway lies
And the lady's eyes grow hungry when she knows the eagles fly

Rock me crazy, wheatfield lady
Oh sweet highway, rock me home
Rock me crazy, wheatfield lady
Take me to my lady at the end of the road

Ah, wheatfield lady, shinnin' in the sun
Ah, my wheatfield lady, call me and I come
Roll me down oh highway sound, sting my wheels to run
Drive me wild, highway child 'till my wheatfield lady comes

Rock me crazy, wheatfield lady
Oh sweet highway, rock me home
Rock me crazy, wheatfield lady
Take me to my lady at the end of the road

Rock me crazy, wheatfield lady
Oh sweet highway, rock me home
Rock me crazy, wheatfield lady
Take me to my lady at the end of the road
