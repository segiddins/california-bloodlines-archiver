She walks in a room and she owns it
Eyes always follow the light
It goes right down to the toes yeah
If you think that she's magic you're right

She can play with your heart like a housecat yeah
Plays with a mouse on the floor
She has no time for the jugular
She finds pretenders a bore

And she looks like a miracle walking
A miracle captured in time
And she sounds like a miracle talking
She's a miracle girl and the miracle's mine
A miracle girl and the miracle's mine
And the miracle's mine

She always has reasons for laughing
Forgiveness is what she does best
She could find love in a tiger
Who growls as he sits on her chest

And she looks like a miracle walking
A miracle captured in time
And she sounds like a miracle talking
She's a miracle girl and the miracle's mine
A miracle girl and the miracle's mine
And the miracle's mine
And the miracle's mine
And the miracle's mine

She's neon in perfume and crazy
With a face of an Angel at times
You'd swear she was dancing in moonlight
And always in three quarter time

And she looks like a miracle walking
A miracle captured in time
And she sounds like a miracle talking
She's a miracle girl and the miracle's mine
A miracle girl and the miracle's mine
And the miracle's mine
And she looks like a miracle walking
A miracle captured in time
And she sounds like a miracle talking
She's a miracle girl and the miracle's mine
A miracle girl and the miracle's mine
And the miracle's mine

And the miracle's mine
And the miracle's mine
And the miracle's mine
