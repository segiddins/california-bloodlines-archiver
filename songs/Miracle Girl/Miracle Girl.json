    "Lyrics": "She walks in a room and she owns it\nEyes always follow the light\nIt goes right down to the toes yeah\nIf you think that she's magic you're right\n\nShe can play with your heart like a housecat yeah\nPlays with a mouse on the floor\nShe has no time for the jugular\nShe finds pretenders a bore\n\nAnd she looks like a miracle walking\nA miracle captured in time\nAnd she sounds like a miracle talking\nShe's a miracle girl and the miracle's mine\nA miracle girl and the miracle's mine\nAnd the miracle's mine\n\nShe always has reasons for laughing\nForgiveness is what she does best\nShe could find love in a tiger\nWho growls as he sits on her chest\n\nAnd she looks like a miracle walking\nA miracle captured in time\nAnd she sounds like a miracle talking\nShe's a miracle girl and the miracle's mine\nA miracle girl and the miracle's mine\nAnd the miracle's mine\nAnd the miracle's mine\nAnd the miracle's mine\n\nShe's neon in perfume and crazy\nWith a face of an Angel at times\nYou'd swear she was dancing in moonlight\nAnd always in three quarter time\n\nAnd she looks like a miracle walking\nA miracle captured in time\nAnd she sounds like a miracle talking\nShe's a miracle girl and the miracle's mine\nA miracle girl and the miracle's mine\nAnd the miracle's mine\nAnd she looks like a miracle walking\nA miracle captured in time\nAnd she sounds like a miracle talking\nShe's a miracle girl and the miracle's mine\nA miracle girl and the miracle's mine\nAnd the miracle's mine\n\nAnd the miracle's mine\nAnd the miracle's mine\nAnd the miracle's mine\n\n",
