Got a ‘59 Cadillac with the top rolled down
On a Springsteen day in a southwest town
Looking for an angel that I used to know
Johnny Flamingo on the blue dream road.

I left Chicago and I drove all night
A hunters moon as the highway light
I hit Galena at a quarter to three
Looking for a girl known only to me

Chorus:
Oh oh follow me home
Johnny Flamingo on the blue dream road
Oh oh where did she go
Johnny Flamingo
On the blue dream road.

Coffee down in Tulsa at the rising of the sun.
Half a tank of gas and it’s Johnny on the run.
Looking for a motel where the neon flickers low.
Johnny Flamingo
On the blue dream road.

The choice of the future the sins of the past
Knowing that time is moving so fast
Moving too fast to carry this load
For Johnny Flamingo
On the blue dream road

(Repeat Chorus)

Holding up in Kingman the Siesta motel,
The sun so hot it was out doing hell.
I don’t have to tell you I was not doing well
Holding up in Kingman at the Siesta Motel.

Before we got to Barstow
There was an itch in my hand
Roy’s Cafe in the Mohave sand
There’s something in the wind
I ought to know
I’m Johnny Flamingo 
On the blue dream road

(Repeat Chorus)

On the Oatman Road there’s a golden gate
Of eucalyptus trees to the golden state.
There’s an angel touching my hand,
Johnny Flamingo in the promised land.

So say it enlightened the moment it comes
Without any fanfare, without any drums.
Before me is a fire without an alarm,
But there’s an angel holding my arm.

(Repeat Chorus)
