There was a girl, a stone man's daughter
And she would rise at the setting sun
And cool her feet in the crystal waters
And pray for grace when the day was done

And there is truth in the gypsy garden
And there are poems in the odd man's wheel
And there is breath in the cold stone rolling
There is death where the Bishop kneels

Comfort me, for I am falling
Comfort me, for it's gone too far
Comfort me, for the rain crow's calling
Comfort me with shining stars

Yellow birds, in the high beamed rafters
Dark black crows, in Mother's yard
Golden girls, it's what I'm after
But the green-eyed queen has dealt the cards

Comfort me, for I am falling
Comfort me, for it's gone too far
Comfort me, for the rain crow's calling
Comfort me with shining stars
Comfort me with shining stars
Comfort me with shining stars
