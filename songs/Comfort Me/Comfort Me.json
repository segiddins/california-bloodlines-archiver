    "Lyrics": "There was a girl, a stone man's daughter\nAnd she would rise at the setting sun\nAnd cool her feet in the crystal waters\nAnd pray for grace when the day was done\n\nAnd there is truth in the gypsy garden\nAnd there are poems in the odd man's wheel\nAnd there is breath in the cold stone rolling\nThere is death where the Bishop kneels\n\nComfort me, for I am falling\nComfort me, for it's gone too far\nComfort me, for the rain crow's calling\nComfort me with shining stars\n\nYellow birds, in the high beamed rafters\nDark black crows, in Mother's yard\nGolden girls, it's what I'm after\nBut the green-eyed queen has dealt the cards\n\nComfort me, for I am falling\nComfort me, for it's gone too far\nComfort me, for the rain crow's calling\nComfort me with shining stars\nComfort me with shining stars\nComfort me with shining stars\n\n",
