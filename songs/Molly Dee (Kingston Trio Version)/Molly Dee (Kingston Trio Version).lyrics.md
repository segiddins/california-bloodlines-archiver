Here we go round again
Singing a song about Molly Dee
Far away I know not where
She's the girl who waits for me

I got a gal in Tennesee
Sweetest little gal that you ever did see
Works all day in a cotton mill
She makes her gin in a bathtub still

Here we go round again
Singing a song about Molly Dee
Far away I know not where
She's the girl who waits for me

My true love's in Memphis town
Pretty little thing named Sally Brown
Travels around on a river boat
Shares her room with a billy goat

Here we go round again
Singing a song about Molly Dee
Far away I know not where
She's the girl who waits for me

Spending my money, gonna drink it away
I'll start saving on another day
Wasting my time in the Silver Dollar
Pinch them gals just to hear 'em holler

Here we go round again
Singing a song about Molly Dee
Far away I know not where
She's the girl who waits for me

Here we go round again
Singing a song about Molly Dee
Far away I know not where
She's the girl who waits for me
She's the girl who waits for me
She's the girl who waits for me
