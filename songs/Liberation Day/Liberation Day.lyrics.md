Sweet sweet smell of jasmine
Knocked me from my feet
And cut the still dry morning
With promises to keep
In a ground floor room surrounded
By the dreams that got away
Everything was perfect
Liberation day
And I went to call the future
All I got was her machine
Had she gone to see Savannah?
The getaway was clean
Everything looked different
The courage and the clay
Everything was perfect
Liberation day

Liberation day is coming
Liberation day is here
Liberation day is funny
Liberation day is near
Liberation day

What about the angels?
Where they always by my side?
Even in Nogales
And all the times I tried to hide?
And all across the crazy
The angels came to play
Everything was perfect
Liberation day
Liberation day
