    "Lyrics": "Sweet sweet smell of jasmine\nKnocked me from my feet\nAnd cut the still dry morning\nWith promises to keep\nIn a ground floor room surrounded\nBy the dreams that got away\nEverything was perfect\nLiberation day\nAnd I went to call the future\nAll I got was her machine\nHad she gone to see Savannah?\nThe getaway was clean\nEverything looked different\nThe courage and the clay\nEverything was perfect\nLiberation day\n\nLiberation day is coming\nLiberation day is here\nLiberation day is funny\nLiberation day is near\nLiberation day\n\nWhat about the angels?\nWhere they always by my side?\nEven in Nogales\nAnd all the times I tried to hide?\nAnd all across the crazy\nThe angels came to play\nEverything was perfect\nLiberation day\nLiberation day\n\n\n",
