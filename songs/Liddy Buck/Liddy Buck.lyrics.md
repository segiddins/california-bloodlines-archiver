You gotta keep running 'cause you can't go back
Everybody's looking for a home
You know you had it all but it had to fall
When you said that you'd go it alone
You'd go it alone

Neither love nor money gonna keep you away
You can't stop the rolling of a stone
Take that, leave that, running on the same track
It's hard you know, hmmmmmm
When you go it alone
A whole lotta luck to you, Liddy Buck
A whole lotta luck to you, Liddy Buck
When you go it alone

And it's been too long
It's gone too far 
Go tear down the sky for a star

A whole lotta luck to you, Liddy Buck
A whole lotta luck to you, Liddy Buck
A whole lotta luck to you, Liddy Buck

You gotta keep running 'cause you can't go back
Everybody's looking for a home
You know you had it all but it had to fall
When you said that you'd go it alone
You'd go it alone

And it's been too long
It's gone too far 
Go tear down the sky for a star
A whole lotta luck to you, Liddy Buck
A whole lotta luck to you, Liddy Buck

And it's been too long
It's gone too far 
Go tear down the sky for a star
A whole lotta luck to you, Liddy Buck
A whole lotta luck to you, Liddy Buck

A whole lotta luck to you, Liddy Buck
