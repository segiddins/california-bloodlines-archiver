It was post time in the meadows,
I had my wager in my hand. 
I was trying to keep the sun out
Of my eyes the best I can.
And I could hear the cheering  
From the people  in the stands, yeah,
Who were waiting for the pony 
Who won at Tanforan.

He was roughed and he was beaten,
He was 'buked and he was scorned. 
He was the horse nobody wanted
From the day that he was born.
And somewhere deep inside him
A voice said,  "I don't give a damn,"
The broken little pony 
Who won at  Tanforan,
The broken little pony, yeah,
Who won at Tanforan.
      
      

And there were rainbows in the infield, yeah,
There were kids upon the rail. 
Clark Gable's in the club house 
With a blonde named Lucy Gale.
There were bookies in fedoras 
Writing numbers on their hands 
For that broken little pony, yeah, 
Who won at Tanforan,
For that broken little pony 
Who won at Tanforan.
      
       

You can smell the tanbark
Where the jockeys all parade, 
And you know they call the horses
When you hear the bugle played.
And here's to all the losers 
Who gathered wings to fly, yeah,
Like that little broken pony 
Who just looked me in the eye.

He's in the hearts of all the people, 
Every woman, hild and man, 
That broken little pony, yeah,
Who won at Tanforan.

He's in the hearts of all the people, 
Every woman, child and man, yeah,
That broken little pony  
Who won at Tanforan.
      
      

And there were rainbows in the infield 
With ponies left to run, 
Where the jockeys' silks were dancing 
As they rode into the sun.

He's in the hearts of all the people, yeah,
Every woman, child and man, 
That broken little pony 
Who won at Tanforan.
He's in the hearts of all the people, 
Every woman, child and man, yeah,
That broken little pony, yeah,
Who won at Tanforan.

He's in the hearts of all the people, yeah,
Every woman,  child and man, yeah,
That little broken pony, yeah,
Who won at Tanforan.
