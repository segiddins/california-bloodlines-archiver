Endless roads and northern lights
Northern roads and endless flights
I'm rollin' honey, home

Freedom was a ball and chain
Freedom was a northern rain
I'm rollin' honey, home

Oooohhh, I'm rollin' honey, home

Endless roads and northern lights
Northern roads and endless flights
I'm rollin' honey, home

Oooohhh, I'm rollin' honey, home

Oooohhh, I'm rollin' honey, home
