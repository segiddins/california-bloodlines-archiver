Missouri birds, flying over old Saint Louis
Hear that song they're singing to me
Go into the world while you're young
But the preacher's words, echo from the old church steeple
"Stay here with the decent people
Settle down and marry while you're young"

If I go into the world Susanna
Oh will you wait for me?
If I go into the world Susanna
I'll come back and tell you what I've seen

The seeds of change, blow across the churchyard to me
Tombstone faces see right through me
Today's so soon tomorrow, and you're old

If I go into the world Susanna
Oh, will you wait for me?
If I go into the world Susanna
I'll come back and tell you what I've seen

Missouri birds, flying over old Saint Louis
Hear that song they're singing to me
Go into the world while you're young
While you're young
