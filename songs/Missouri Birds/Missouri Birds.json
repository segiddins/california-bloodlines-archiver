    "Lyrics": "Missouri birds, flying over old Saint Louis\nHear that song they're singing to me\nGo into the world while you're young\nBut the preacher's words, echo from the old church steeple\n\"Stay here with the decent people\nSettle down and marry while you're young\"\n\nIf I go into the world Susanna\nOh will you wait for me?\nIf I go into the world Susanna\nI'll come back and tell you what I've seen\n\nThe seeds of change, blow across the churchyard to me\nTombstone faces see right through me\nToday's so soon tomorrow, and you're old\n\nIf I go into the world Susanna\nOh, will you wait for me?\nIf I go into the world Susanna\nI'll come back and tell you what I've seen\n\nMissouri birds, flying over old Saint Louis\nHear that song they're singing to me\nGo into the world while you're young\nWhile you're young\n\n",
