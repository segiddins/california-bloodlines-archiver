    "Lyrics": "Shoot the man down\nNever let him see the rising of the sun\nShoot the man down\nIt's the only way to win for those who hold the gun\nBut I'm not afraid of dark streets in the night\nNot afraid of blades that catch the light\nMy nightmares take a different shape it seems\nCause I'm afraid of falling from my dreams\nYes I'm afraid of falling from my dreams\n\nSoon the mad clowns are only gonna be\nThe shadows of their skins\nAnd all the sad clowns that shoot the horse down\nWill find there's another way to win\nSharks upon the water swim on by\nBarking dogs don't even have to try\nMy nightmares take a different shape it seems\nCause I'm afraid of falling from my dreams\nYes I'm afraid of falling from my dreams\n\n",
