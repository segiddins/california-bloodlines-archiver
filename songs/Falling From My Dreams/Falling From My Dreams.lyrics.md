Shoot the man down
Never let him see the rising of the sun
Shoot the man down
It's the only way to win for those who hold the gun
But I'm not afraid of dark streets in the night
Not afraid of blades that catch the light
My nightmares take a different shape it seems
Cause I'm afraid of falling from my dreams
Yes I'm afraid of falling from my dreams

Soon the mad clowns are only gonna be
The shadows of their skins
And all the sad clowns that shoot the horse down
Will find there's another way to win
Sharks upon the water swim on by
Barking dogs don't even have to try
My nightmares take a different shape it seems
Cause I'm afraid of falling from my dreams
Yes I'm afraid of falling from my dreams
