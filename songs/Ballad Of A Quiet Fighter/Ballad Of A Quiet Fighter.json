    "Lyrics": "Oh, I stood watching\nOh, I stood waiting\nAnd as the rivers of freedom run through this land\nI'll be there for to lend you my hand\n\nWell I listened to the shouting of those with their lies that tore at the heart of this country of mine . . .\n\nBut here's where a quiet man\nWith truth in his hand\nCan make a stand\nAnd be heard in this land\n\nSo, I stood watching\nOh, I stood waiting\nAnd as the rivers of freedom run through this land\nI'll be there for to lend you my hand\n\nSo, I stood by the watch road til the October of their days when the winds to my left and then far to my right were blowing my way . . .\n\nBut, now is the hour\nThe time I can see\nWhen we'll win with the truth\nThat has made us so free\n\nSo, I stood watching\nOh, I stood waiting\nAnd as the rivers of freedom run through this land\nI'll be there for to lend you my hand\n\nOh, I stood watching\nOh, I stood waiting\n\n",
