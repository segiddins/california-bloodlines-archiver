Oh, I stood watching
Oh, I stood waiting
And as the rivers of freedom run through this land
I'll be there for to lend you my hand

Well I listened to the shouting of those with their lies that tore at the heart of this country of mine . . .

But here's where a quiet man
With truth in his hand
Can make a stand
And be heard in this land

So, I stood watching
Oh, I stood waiting
And as the rivers of freedom run through this land
I'll be there for to lend you my hand

So, I stood by the watch road til the October of their days when the winds to my left and then far to my right were blowing my way . . .

But, now is the hour
The time I can see
When we'll win with the truth
That has made us so free

So, I stood watching
Oh, I stood waiting
And as the rivers of freedom run through this land
I'll be there for to lend you my hand

Oh, I stood watching
Oh, I stood waiting
