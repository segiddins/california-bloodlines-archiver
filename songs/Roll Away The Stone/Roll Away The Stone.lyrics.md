In Valley Forge long ago
A nation born in snow
To make it ours we carved their names in stone
And if that is all we own
Old memories in stone
Don't you think it's time that we made some of our own?

Roll away, roll away, oh roll away the stone
Roll away, roll away
People of America, roll away the stone

Oh, we build 'em high and we build 'em wide
'Till there's no place left to hide
For the motels and the coffee shops and the flashing neon signs
Are we cursed, are we blind?
Have we all lost our minds?
The cities made of stone, is that all we'll leave behind?

Roll away, roll away, oh, roll away the stone
Roll away, roll away
People of America, roll away the stone

Roll away, roll away, oh, roll away the stone
Roll away, roll away
People of America, roll away the stone
