    "Lyrics": "I've used up all my options and I've emptied my reserves\nMy tricks are fooling no one and I'm running now on nerves\nI'm feeling like the astronauts as the world just slips away\nIt's not that I am desperate, it's not that I don't pray\n\nVictories of the young and hungry don't escape me now\nIt's not I don't remember, it's that I've forgotten how\nI'm collecting useless boxes and lines upon my face\nIt's the perfect place to be when all that's left is faith\n\nLiving in denial has always worked before\nIt's so loud it almost masks the slamming of the door\nI can't believe I'm getting old, as if I never would\nThe arrogance of youth is not easily understood\n\nI've used up all my options and I've emptied my reserves\nMy tricks are fooling no one and I'm running now on nerves\nI'm feeling like the astronauts as the world just slips away\nIt's not that I am desperate, it's not that I don't pray\nSo I'm collecting useless boxes and lines upon my face\nIt's the perfect place to be when all that's left is faith\n\n",
