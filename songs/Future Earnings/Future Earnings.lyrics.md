I've used up all my options and I've emptied my reserves
My tricks are fooling no one and I'm running now on nerves
I'm feeling like the astronauts as the world just slips away
It's not that I am desperate, it's not that I don't pray

Victories of the young and hungry don't escape me now
It's not I don't remember, it's that I've forgotten how
I'm collecting useless boxes and lines upon my face
It's the perfect place to be when all that's left is faith

Living in denial has always worked before
It's so loud it almost masks the slamming of the door
I can't believe I'm getting old, as if I never would
The arrogance of youth is not easily understood

I've used up all my options and I've emptied my reserves
My tricks are fooling no one and I'm running now on nerves
I'm feeling like the astronauts as the world just slips away
It's not that I am desperate, it's not that I don't pray
So I'm collecting useless boxes and lines upon my face
It's the perfect place to be when all that's left is faith
