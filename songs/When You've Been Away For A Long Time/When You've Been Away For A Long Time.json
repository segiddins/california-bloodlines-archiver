    "Lyrics": "When you've been away from the color of the sky\nWhen you've been away for a long time\nYou will see it true. It's a different shade of blue\nWhen you've been away for a long time\n\nWhen you've been away from the music in your heart\nWhen you've been away for a long time\nThe songs come back again like an old familiar friend\nWhen you've been away for a long time\n\nI can hear, I can see\nI can feel, I am free\nAnd I've been away for a long time\n\nWhen you've been away from a lovin' in your soul\nWhen you've been away for a long time\nI hear it's like a rain that washes all your pain\nWhen you've been away for a long time\n\nWhen you've been away from someone you once knew\nWhen you've been away for a long time\nIf you find it true that someone was just you\nThen you've been away for a long time\n\nI can hear, I can see\nI can feel, I am free\nAnd I've been away\nI've been away\nI've been away for a long time\n\n",
