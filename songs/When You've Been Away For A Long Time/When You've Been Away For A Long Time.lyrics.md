When you've been away from the color of the sky
When you've been away for a long time
You will see it true. It's a different shade of blue
When you've been away for a long time

When you've been away from the music in your heart
When you've been away for a long time
The songs come back again like an old familiar friend
When you've been away for a long time

I can hear, I can see
I can feel, I am free
And I've been away for a long time

When you've been away from a lovin' in your soul
When you've been away for a long time
I hear it's like a rain that washes all your pain
When you've been away for a long time

When you've been away from someone you once knew
When you've been away for a long time
If you find it true that someone was just you
Then you've been away for a long time

I can hear, I can see
I can feel, I am free
And I've been away
I've been away
I've been away for a long time
