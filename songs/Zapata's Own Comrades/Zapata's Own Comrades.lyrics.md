Juanita walks down to the well, she is angry and dry,
Where the bandits' own horses are tied in the trees there to hide.  
And the guns are all rusted, the spirit is bright in her eyes,
As Zapata´s own comrades sing out the legend, the song is that he is alive.

Viva you Mexico, viva the hills,
The song of the people is singing there still.
Viva you Mexico, viva say I,
The song is that he is alive.
        

Ah, Santa Maria, do the old women live just to cry?
´Cause the men of the mountains go singing the legend, the song is that he is alive.
He is the eagle, the wind and the stallion, I cry.
He is there in the mountains, he´ll come when we need him.
The song is that he is alive.

Viva you Mexico, viva the hills,
The song of the people is singing there still.
Viva you Mexico, viva say I,
The song is that he is alive.
Viva you Mexico, viva the hills,
The song of the people is singing there still.
Viva you Mexico, viva say I,
The song is that he is alive.

Heeee heeee,
Heeee heeee,
Heeee heeee.
