    "Lyrics": "Juanita walks down to the well, she is angry and dry,\nWhere the bandits' own horses are tied in the trees there to hide.  \nAnd the guns are all rusted, the spirit is bright in her eyes,\nAs Zapata´s own comrades sing out the legend, the song is that he is alive.\n\nViva you Mexico, viva the hills,\nThe song of the people is singing there still.\nViva you Mexico, viva say I,\nThe song is that he is alive.\n        \n\nAh, Santa Maria, do the old women live just to cry?\n´Cause the men of the mountains go singing the legend, the song is that he is alive.\nHe is the eagle, the wind and the stallion, I cry.\nHe is there in the mountains, he´ll come when we need him.\nThe song is that he is alive.\n\nViva you Mexico, viva the hills,\nThe song of the people is singing there still.\nViva you Mexico, viva say I,\nThe song is that he is alive.\nViva you Mexico, viva the hills,\nThe song of the people is singing there still.\nViva you Mexico, viva say I,\nThe song is that he is alive.\n\nHeeee heeee,\nHeeee heeee,\nHeeee heeee.\n\n",
