If something happened to you
Part of me would die
If something good came through
Part of me would fly
It's a critical focus
For I know who you are yeah
You are the light that flashes
In the night of a distant star
You are the light that flashes
In the night of a distant star
Of a distant star

If I had not seen you
I would know you're here
In the crowd of a subway station
Oh, I would feel you near
So build me a fire
So I know where you are
For you are the light that flashes
In the night of a distant star
For you are the light that flashes
In the night of a distant star
Of a distant star

As moonlight covers the sky
A sailor watches the cross
And I am searching your eyes
And the miles yet to be crossed
Nothing here is free
We can all show the scars
In the search for the missing pieces
In the night of a distant star
In the search for the missing pieces
In the night of a distant star
Of a distant star

You are the light the flashes
In the night of a distant star
Oh, you are the light the flashes
In the night of a distant star
In the night of a distant star
Of a distant star
