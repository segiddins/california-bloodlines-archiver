    "Lyrics": "If something happened to you\nPart of me would die\nIf something good came through\nPart of me would fly\nIt's a critical focus\nFor I know who you are yeah\nYou are the light that flashes\nIn the night of a distant star\nYou are the light that flashes\nIn the night of a distant star\nOf a distant star\n\nIf I had not seen you\nI would know you're here\nIn the crowd of a subway station\nOh, I would feel you near\nSo build me a fire\nSo I know where you are\nFor you are the light that flashes\nIn the night of a distant star\nFor you are the light that flashes\nIn the night of a distant star\nOf a distant star\n\nAs moonlight covers the sky\nA sailor watches the cross\nAnd I am searching your eyes\nAnd the miles yet to be crossed\nNothing here is free\nWe can all show the scars\nIn the search for the missing pieces\nIn the night of a distant star\nIn the search for the missing pieces\nIn the night of a distant star\nOf a distant star\n\nYou are the light the flashes\nIn the night of a distant star\nOh, you are the light the flashes\nIn the night of a distant star\nIn the night of a distant star\nOf a distant star\n\n",
