Down in the valley
At the sunrise you'll find
Jose and Maria on old 405
And he said to Maria
"I' II call you tonight
After the claim stake
When everything's right"

And they're driving to Glendale
And the race is at noon
His coffee's too hot
And he's boarding too soon
To stare out the window
At Camino Real
As they saddle the horses
At Golden Gate Fields

And the horses and jockeys
While the danger is real
At post time and coast time
At Golden Gate Fields

Now, Lefty, he's the shooter
He arrived at the track
His stash and his needles
In the bag on his back
And they're leading the horses
Out of the barn
Lefty's in line
With the tracks on his arm

And he's looking for a horse
To get through the day
That's why he's the shooter
And he's willing to pay
The price of the monkey
Who takes him away
He's a-betting on horses
That don't ever pay

And the horses and junkies
The danger is real
At the post time and the coast time
At Golden Gate Fields
And the horses and the junkies
And the dangers are real
At the post time and the coast time
At Golden Gate Fields

Now the first race
Is the claim stake
And Jose is back
Holding the reins
Staying back in the pack
Around the far turn
He gives him his slack
Avoiding the horses
Now flat on their backs

And the horses and the junkies
And the dangers are real
At the post time and the coast time
At Golden Gate Fields

Jose and Maria
And Lefty and junk
Who will ride for the thrills
And what's in their trunk?
And they're counting on angels
Who know how it feels
At post time and coast time
At Golden Gate Fields

For the horses and jockeys
And the dangers are real
At post time and coast time
At Golden Gate Fields
And the horses and junkies
And the dangers are real
At the post time and coast time
At Golden Gate Fields
