Saturday night
Wheels along the boulevard
You're looking alright
'Cause love don't come too hard
To the Queen of Hollywood High

The boys are on the move
Hustling the boulevard
She knows she couldn't loose
Still she never gets that far
The Queen Of Hollywood High

Hollywood High
The Queen of Hollywood High

There are spirit's taking flight
And wings across the boulevard
They're dancing in the night
And they're calling her across the yard
The Queen of Hollywood High

Hollywood High
The Queen of Hollywood High

The Angels fly in the northern sky
Only for the Queen of Hollywood High
The Angels fly in the northern sky
Only for the Queen of Hollywood High

Saturday night
Wheels along the boulevard
You're looking alright
'Cause love don't come too hard
To the Queen of Hollywood High

Hollywood High
The Queen of Hollywood High

The Angels fly in the northern sky
Only for the Queen of Hollywood High
The Angels fly in the northern sky
Only for the Queen of Hollywood High
The Angels fly in the northern sky
Only for the Queen of Hollywood High
The Angels fly in the northern sky
Only for the Queen of Hollywood High

Oh, Saturday night
With the Queen of Hollywood High
The boy's are taking flight
Of the Queen of Hollywood High
And they're dancing in the night
With the Queen of Hollywood
She's the Queen of Hollywood
She's the Queen Of Hollywood High

Hollywood High
The Queen of Hollywood High
