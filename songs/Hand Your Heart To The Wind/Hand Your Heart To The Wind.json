    "Lyrics": "There's always one more river the sea can carry\nThere's always one more soul that heaven can hold\nThere's always one more star the sky can hang on to\nSo hand your heart to the wind, let it carry you home\n\nThere's always one more song to sing for the lonely\nThere's always one more dream to carry you along\nThere's always one more eagle come flying in the morning\nSo hand your heart to the wind let it carry you home\n\nSo, hand your heart to the wind\nLet it carry you away once again\nHand your heart to the wind\nLet it carry you home\n\nThere's always one more reason to keep you braving\nThere's always one more angel to carry you home\nThere's always one more rainbow, anywhere that you go\nSo hand your heart to the wind let it carry you home\n\nSo, hand your heart to the wind\nLet it carry you away once again\nHand your heart to the wind\nLet it carry you home\n\nLet it carry you home\nCarry you home\n\n",
