There's always one more river the sea can carry
There's always one more soul that heaven can hold
There's always one more star the sky can hang on to
So hand your heart to the wind, let it carry you home

There's always one more song to sing for the lonely
There's always one more dream to carry you along
There's always one more eagle come flying in the morning
So hand your heart to the wind let it carry you home

So, hand your heart to the wind
Let it carry you away once again
Hand your heart to the wind
Let it carry you home

There's always one more reason to keep you braving
There's always one more angel to carry you home
There's always one more rainbow, anywhere that you go
So hand your heart to the wind let it carry you home

So, hand your heart to the wind
Let it carry you away once again
Hand your heart to the wind
Let it carry you home

Let it carry you home
Carry you home
