Just an old love song the boys can all sing
Pumping gas on them long cold nights
Just an old love song the boys can all sing
Pumping gas on them long cold nights

Just an old love song for dung dirty girls
Who feel like they're dreaming again
Just an old love song for dung dirty girls
Who feel like they're dreaming again

Just an old love song
Just an old love song
Just an old love song for you
Oh, it's just an old love song
Just an old love song
Any old love song will do

Just an old love song for kids everywhere
Getting on in the back seat of the car
Just an old love song for kids everywhere
God love ya, getting on in the back of the car

Just an old love song
Just an old love song
Just an old love song for you
Oh, it's just an old love song
Just an old love song
Any old love song will do

Just an old love song
Just an old love song
Just an old love song for you
Oh, it's just an old love song
Just an old love song
Any old love song will do
