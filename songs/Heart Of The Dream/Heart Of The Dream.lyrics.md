Here I am in the heart of the land
Where they sell it on the run and they steal it if they can
Living in the heart of the dream in the Promised Land

Oh, it's heartbreak alley on the coast highway
They never made girls like that in my day
Living in the heart of the dream
Living in the heart of the dream
Living in the heart of the dream in the Promised Land

Oh, I'm living in the heart, living in the heart
Living in the heart of the dream in the Promised Land
Living in the heart of the dream in the Promised Land

Oh, it's slow take, soul shake, Perrier and earthquake
Everybody's waiting for the day they get their big break
Living in the heart of the dream in the Promised Land

And here I am with my ass in the sand
Getting my goodies with a rock and roll band
Living in the heart of the dream
Living in the heart of the dream
Living in the heart of the dream in the Promised Land

And I'm living in the heart, living in the heart
Living in the heart of the dream in the Promised Land
Living in the heart of the dream in the Promised Land

Hell, I got it all and I still want more
Looking for the west with my feet on the shore
Living in the heart of the dream
I'm living in the heart of the dream
Yeah, I'm living in the heart of the dream in the Promised Land

And I'm living in the heart, living in the heart
Living in the heart of the dream in the Promised Land
Living in the heart of the dream in the Promised Land
