    "Lyrics": "Here I am in the heart of the land\nWhere they sell it on the run and they steal it if they can\nLiving in the heart of the dream in the Promised Land\n\nOh, it's heartbreak alley on the coast highway\nThey never made girls like that in my day\nLiving in the heart of the dream\nLiving in the heart of the dream\nLiving in the heart of the dream in the Promised Land\n\nOh, I'm living in the heart, living in the heart\nLiving in the heart of the dream in the Promised Land\nLiving in the heart of the dream in the Promised Land\n\nOh, it's slow take, soul shake, Perrier and earthquake\nEverybody's waiting for the day they get their big break\nLiving in the heart of the dream in the Promised Land\n\nAnd here I am with my ass in the sand\nGetting my goodies with a rock and roll band\nLiving in the heart of the dream\nLiving in the heart of the dream\nLiving in the heart of the dream in the Promised Land\n\nAnd I'm living in the heart, living in the heart\nLiving in the heart of the dream in the Promised Land\nLiving in the heart of the dream in the Promised Land\n\nHell, I got it all and I still want more\nLooking for the west with my feet on the shore\nLiving in the heart of the dream\nI'm living in the heart of the dream\nYeah, I'm living in the heart of the dream in the Promised Land\n\nAnd I'm living in the heart, living in the heart\nLiving in the heart of the dream in the Promised Land\nLiving in the heart of the dream in the Promised Land\n\n",
