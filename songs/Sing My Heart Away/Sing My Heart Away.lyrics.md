Standing in the middle of all that city
Who will sing my heart away
So many people here it’s a pity
Who will sing my heart away
Who will sing my heart away

Standing in the middle of a million faces
Who will sing my heart away
A million people looking in a million places
Who will sing my heart away
Who will sing my heart away

And a voice on the radio it knows my name
Like the songs that Boudelaux rhymes
Music on the radio is not the same
As the songs I heard when your eyes met mine

So many reasons you’re my one and only
Who will sing my heart away
It is the season of the walking lonely
Who will sing my heart away
Who will sing my heart away

And a voice on the radio it knows my name
Like the songs that Boudelaux rhymes
Music on the radio is not the same
As the songs I heard when your eyes met mine

Standing in the middle of all that city
Who will sing my heart away
So many people here it’s a pity
Who will sing my heart away
Who will sing my heart away
