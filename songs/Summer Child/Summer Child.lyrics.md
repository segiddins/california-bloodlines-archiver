She was never a summer child
No, never at all
She liked the cool of the spring
And the damp of the fall
For the heat of the summer
Made her bitchy and mean
As she watched for the hired man
Quiet and lean

She was never a summer child
No, never at all
It was the time of the creatures
That slithered and crawled
She'd stand in her window
With her back to the light
She knew I was watching
Like a moth in the night

Go down easy, go down slow
Go down easy child
There's a lot of summer left to go
There's a lot of summer left to go

She was never a summer child
At least that's what she said
She said the voices were crazy
That talked in her head
She'd tap on my door
And ask to come in
She'd move through the grass
Like a witch in the wind

Yea, that summer in Macon
The year of '45
Is burned in my brain
Till the day that I die

Go down easy, go down slow
Go down easy, go down slow
Go down easy, go down slow
Go down easy, go down slow

Go down easy, go down slow
Go down easy child
There's a lot of summer left to go
There's a lot of summer left to go

She was never a summer child
No, never at all
 
Go down easy, go down slow
Go down easy, go down slow
Go down easy, go down slow
Go down easy, go down slow
