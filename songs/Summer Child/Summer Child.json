    "Lyrics": "She was never a summer child\nNo, never at all\nShe liked the cool of the spring\nAnd the damp of the fall\nFor the heat of the summer\nMade her bitchy and mean\nAs she watched for the hired man\nQuiet and lean\n\nShe was never a summer child\nNo, never at all\nIt was the time of the creatures\nThat slithered and crawled\nShe'd stand in her window\nWith her back to the light\nShe knew I was watching\nLike a moth in the night\n\nGo down easy, go down slow\nGo down easy child\nThere's a lot of summer left to go\nThere's a lot of summer left to go\n\nShe was never a summer child\nAt least that's what she said\nShe said the voices were crazy\nThat talked in her head\nShe'd tap on my door\nAnd ask to come in\nShe'd move through the grass\nLike a witch in the wind\n\nYea, that summer in Macon\nThe year of '45\nIs burned in my brain\nTill the day that I die\n\nGo down easy, go down slow\nGo down easy, go down slow\nGo down easy, go down slow\nGo down easy, go down slow\n\nGo down easy, go down slow\nGo down easy child\nThere's a lot of summer left to go\nThere's a lot of summer left to go\n\nShe was never a summer child\nNo, never at all\n \nGo down easy, go down slow\nGo down easy, go down slow\nGo down easy, go down slow\nGo down easy, go down slow\n\n",
