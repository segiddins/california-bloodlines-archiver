Young holy-roller
I've gone and stolen her
Away from the holy man
His bible and beads
Young holy-roller
What could be holier
Than all of the love
Shining between you and me

See the light come shine
See the light come shine
See the light come and shine right on me
See the light come shine
See the light come shine
See the light come and shine right on me

Lonely rover
I was the lonely one
You aren't the only one
Who yearns to be free
Lonely rovers
We are the lonely ones
Who look for the light
Like a ship on the sea

See the light come shine
See the light come shine
See the light come and shine right on me
See the light come shine
See the light come shine
See the light come and shine right on me
