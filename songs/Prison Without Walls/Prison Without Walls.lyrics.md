He sees them on the sidewalk yeah, where they slept the night before
Children of the nowhere, people without doors
And he said "I'd never sink that low", he said "I'd never fall
To find that I'm a prisoner in a prison without walls"

He had a job in Michigan, you could count the scars
Eight years of throwing motors into Iacoca's cars
And then one day they let him go, there was nothing left at all
He said "I'm afraid I'll be a prisoner in a prison without walls"

All he ever wanted was a home for Sleepy Jean
And his only sin, believing in America the dream
He said "I thought I'd never sink this low, thought I'd never fall
Here I am, a prisoner, in a prison without walls"

And one by one, we'll find a way you know
One by one, we'll find a way, you know
One by one, we'll find a way 'till no one's left at all
Who finds that they're a prisoner, yeah, in a prison without walls

In prison without walls
In prison without walls
In prison without walls
In prison without walls
