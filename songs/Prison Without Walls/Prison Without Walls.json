    "Lyrics": "He sees them on the sidewalk yeah, where they slept the night before\nChildren of the nowhere, people without doors\nAnd he said \"I'd never sink that low\", he said \"I'd never fall\nTo find that I'm a prisoner in a prison without walls\"\n\nHe had a job in Michigan, you could count the scars\nEight years of throwing motors into Iacoca's cars\nAnd then one day they let him go, there was nothing left at all\nHe said \"I'm afraid I'll be a prisoner in a prison without walls\"\n\nAll he ever wanted was a home for Sleepy Jean\nAnd his only sin, believing in America the dream\nHe said \"I thought I'd never sink this low, thought I'd never fall\nHere I am, a prisoner, in a prison without walls\"\n\nAnd one by one, we'll find a way you know\nOne by one, we'll find a way, you know\nOne by one, we'll find a way 'till no one's left at all\nWho finds that they're a prisoner, yeah, in a prison without walls\n\nIn prison without walls\nIn prison without walls\nIn prison without walls\nIn prison without walls\n\n",
