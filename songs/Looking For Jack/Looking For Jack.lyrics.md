We were living in a magic time
We were living with time to burn
Believing we had nowhere to go, 
Believing we had nothing to learn.

Had the big time dreams,
Self-inflicted wounds, 
Bullets in the hour glass
Life on other moons

I will work for food
I will work for fame
I will work for money
I will work the game.

What are you working for,
Do you know the name?
Don’t kid yourself,
They are not the same.

Chorus:

Unchain the dogs
Cause I’m back again. 
Just looking for Jack 
On the other side of the wind

But I can’t seem to reach you, 
With words in the way
The moon’s behind a cloud, 
The night porters say, 
Collective blessings
Get you through the day. 
A limited truce, 
Can we live this way?

The promise of the crossing
The house dogs sound
To find ground zero,
You just look straight down.
The final sighting, 
Waiting for the light,
With lawyers on my lawn 
Another sleepless night

(Repeat Chorus)
