It's midnight in Havana, there's a party on the streets
Nylons on the sea wall, music on the beach
It's midnight in Havana, young girls in the streets

Will someone dance fandango yeah, with Epiphany tonight
I believe that she needs someone to make her feel that it's alright
Will someone dance fandango yeah, with Epiphany tonight

She has seen the boats go out from the dark beach late at night
She believes she saw the glow of the blue Miami lights
She has seen the boats row out from the dark beach late at night

And though the revolution came way before her time
There is a resolution to the old man's party line
Oh, the revolution came and it has had it's time

Waiting for Castro to die, waiting for Castro to die
And oh, it should be magic yeah, in the morning sky
And oh, it should be magic yeah, in every young girls eyes
And oh, it should be magic as they're waiting for Castro to die

The sands of Varadero are lined with diamond dust
Blondes read German novels yeah, Yankee dollars are discussed
The sands of Varadero the one the Euros trust

She could ride the railroad yeah, that robbed the sugar cane
Take pictures of Guantanamo before the hurricane 
She could ride the railroad yeah, who's steam would feel like rain

Waiting for Castro to die, waiting for Castro to die
And oh, it should be magic yeah, in the morning sky
And oh, it should be magic yeah, in every young girls eyes
And oh, it should be magic as they're waiting for Castro to die

It's midnight in Havana, there's a party on the streets
Nylons on the sea wall, music on the beach
It's midnight in Havana, young girls in the streets

Waiting for Castro to die
Waiting for Castro to die
Waiting for Castro to die
