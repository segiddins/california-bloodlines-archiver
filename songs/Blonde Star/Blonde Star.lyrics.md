Sisterhood in the heartland
Little scenes in the rain
You sold your life for a rock and roll band
You sold your heart as the price of fame
In the heartland

Another man's gone in the heartland
Gone with his heart in his hand
Another man's gone and he can't understand
Don't you know that another can?
In the heartland

Did the ghost of Dallas make you cry?
Blonde star in the Texas sky
In the heartland

Sisterhood in the heartland
Little scenes in the rain
You sold your life for a rock and roll band
You sold your heart as the price of fame
In the heartland

Did the ghost of Dallas make you cry?
Blonde star in the Texas sky
In the heartland

Blonde star in the Texas sky
Blonde star in the Texas sky
Blonde star in the Texas sky
In the heartland
