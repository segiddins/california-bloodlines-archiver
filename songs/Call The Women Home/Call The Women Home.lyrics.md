Oh, northern light up in the sky
You can see it if you try
See it moves from left to right
I didn't see it there last night
You better call the women home
You better call the women home
Call the women home

For every time the rain crow calls
Seems another nation falls
And every time the rain crow sings
Another lover feels the sting
You better call the women home
You better call the women home
Call the women home

And the rattle of the rosary beads
Is just another sound we need
For every time the rain crow kills
Another Angel takes the hills
You better call the women home
You better call the women home
Call the women home

Oh, there's a light up in the sky
You can see it if you try
See it moves from left to right
I didn't see it there last night
You better call the women home
You better call the women home
Call the women home
