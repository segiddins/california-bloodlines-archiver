It was more than Indiana, it was more than South Dakota
It was more than California, it was more than Oregon
It was a race against time, it was always on our minds
And he died on the road

We were tired, we were hungry, we were livin' on a dream
For all forgotten people never heard and never seen
That there would come a time, for a moment day would shine
And it died on the road

Truly as the sun, truly as the rain
Truly I believe that it was the last campaign
Truly as the sun, truly as the rain
Oh, truly I believe that it was the last campaign

It was more than Indiana, it was more than South Dakota
It was more than California, it was more than Oregon
It was a race against time, it was always on our minds
And he died on the road


There ain't no wild horses out on Wild Horse Road 
There ain't no wild horses there, I know
Somewhere they're truckin' mustangs on a lonesome desert road
But there ain't no wild horses out on Wild Horse Road
			
Runnin' down a mustang, oh, what'll it take
A pickup and a gun
Hey, young moonlight gunner
Where's the sun?
And don't it make you feel
Like kickin' in a white wall
Now you finally know
There ain't no wild horses out on Wild Horse Road
 

Shoot all the brave horses and how will we ride?
Shoot all the brave horses and how will we ride?
Shoot all the brave horses and how will we ride?
And ford the cold waters, how will we ride?
 Shoot all the brave horses and how will we ride?
Shoot all the brave horses and how will we ride?
Shoot all the brave horses and how will we ride?
And ford the cold waters, how will we ride?

Shoot all the brave horses and how will we ride?
Shoot all the brave horses and how will we ride?
Shoot all the brave horses and how will we ride?
And ford the cold waters, how will we ride?


Truly as the sun, truly as the rain
Truly I believe that it was the last campaign
