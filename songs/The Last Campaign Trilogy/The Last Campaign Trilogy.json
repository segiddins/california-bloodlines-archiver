    "Lyrics": "It was more than Indiana, it was more than South Dakota\nIt was more than California, it was more than Oregon\nIt was a race against time, it was always on our minds\nAnd he died on the road\n\nWe were tired, we were hungry, we were livin' on a dream\nFor all forgotten people never heard and never seen\nThat there would come a time, for a moment day would shine\nAnd it died on the road\n\nTruly as the sun, truly as the rain\nTruly I believe that it was the last campaign\nTruly as the sun, truly as the rain\nOh, truly I believe that it was the last campaign\n\nIt was more than Indiana, it was more than South Dakota\nIt was more than California, it was more than Oregon\nIt was a race against time, it was always on our minds\nAnd he died on the road\n\n\nThere ain't no wild horses out on Wild Horse Road \nThere ain't no wild horses there, I know\nSomewhere they're truckin' mustangs on a lonesome desert road\nBut there ain't no wild horses out on Wild Horse Road\n\t\t\t\nRunnin' down a mustang, oh, what'll it take\nA pickup and a gun\nHey, young moonlight gunner\nWhere's the sun?\nAnd don't it make you feel\nLike kickin' in a white wall\nNow you finally know\nThere ain't no wild horses out on Wild Horse Road\n \n\nShoot all the brave horses and how will we ride?\nShoot all the brave horses and how will we ride?\nShoot all the brave horses and how will we ride?\nAnd ford the cold waters, how will we ride?\n Shoot all the brave horses and how will we ride?\nShoot all the brave horses and how will we ride?\nShoot all the brave horses and how will we ride?\nAnd ford the cold waters, how will we ride?\n\nShoot all the brave horses and how will we ride?\nShoot all the brave horses and how will we ride?\nShoot all the brave horses and how will we ride?\nAnd ford the cold waters, how will we ride?\n\n\nTruly as the sun, truly as the rain\nTruly I believe that it was the last campaign\n\n",
