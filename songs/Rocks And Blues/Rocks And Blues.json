    "Lyrics": "The telephone rang, late last night\nAnd of course I've got to go\nMaking my way through the people and the ticket takers\nAnd why I do not know\n \nWhy should I go to New York City?\nI don't have a clue\nOh man on the moon, yeah I know how you feel\nYou went a long way for the rocks and blues\n \nI've lost more friends to the devil woman fame\nThan I have to drugs and booze\nI've seen my old lady on the cover of the Rolling Stone\nAnd on the Evening News\n \nBut this is my song, keep on singing 'fore it gets away\nAnd I can't afford the shoes\nOh man on the moon, I know how you feel\nYou went a long way for the rocks and blues\n \nThere ain't no gold at the end of the rainbow\nThere's just a motel room\nNo stars in your crown as you're looking straight down\nAnd you don't know what to do...\n \nBut Mill Valley people they keep living life every day\nAny way they choose\nOh man on the moon, yeah I know how you feel\nYou went a long way for the rocks and blues\n\n",
