The telephone rang, late last night
And of course I've got to go
Making my way through the people and the ticket takers
And why I do not know
 
Why should I go to New York City?
I don't have a clue
Oh man on the moon, yeah I know how you feel
You went a long way for the rocks and blues
 
I've lost more friends to the devil woman fame
Than I have to drugs and booze
I've seen my old lady on the cover of the Rolling Stone
And on the Evening News
 
But this is my song, keep on singing 'fore it gets away
And I can't afford the shoes
Oh man on the moon, I know how you feel
You went a long way for the rocks and blues
 
There ain't no gold at the end of the rainbow
There's just a motel room
No stars in your crown as you're looking straight down
And you don't know what to do...
 
But Mill Valley people they keep living life every day
Any way they choose
Oh man on the moon, yeah I know how you feel
You went a long way for the rocks and blues
