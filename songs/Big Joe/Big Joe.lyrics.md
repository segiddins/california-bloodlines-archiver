He's a big wheel driver, Mamma
Working for the trucking Co.
Driving those big old semi-rigs
Through the roads in Ohio
Thought that you should know
Big Joe, he ain't ever coming home

He's a big wheel driver, Mamma
And he knows how to drive her right
And there ain't I know, a woman alone 
Who wouldn't kill to stay the night
Thought that you should know
Big Joe, he ain't ever coming home

Ah, but you can spread your wings
Mamma you can learn to fly again
Spread your wings
Mamma you can find another friend
Thought that you should know
Big Joe he ain't ever coming home

He's a big wheel driver, Mamma
He's got a name on his tattooed arm
Of a woman that he had when he was but a lad 
He used to take her out behind the barn
I thought that you should know
Big Joe, he ain't ever coming home

Ah, but you can spread your wings
Mamma you can learn to fly again
Spread your wings
Mamma you can find another friend
Thought that you should know
Big Joe he ain't ever coming home

Thought that you should know
Big Joe he ain't ever coming home
Thought that you should know
Men like Joe ain't ever coming home
Thought that you should know
Big Joe he ain't ever coming home
