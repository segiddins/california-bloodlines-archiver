All the lights and all the towns
And all the wheels turning round
And all the stars, if you count 'em down
Are less than love, when one heart's found
Less than love, when one hearts found

And all the songs that were ever sung
And all the dreams that keep you young
And all the bells that were ever rung
Are less than love, when one heart's stung
Less than love, when one heart's stung

All the years and all good-byes
And all the times, that we just don't try
And all the dreams that will never die
Are less than love, where two hearts lie
Less than love, where two hearts lie

All the lights and all the towns
And all the wheels turning round
And all the stars, if you count 'em down
Are less than love, when one heart's found
Less than love, when one hearts found
