Jamie caught the firefly, la, da, da
Jamie caught the firefly, put it in a jar
Jamie caught the firefly, la, da, da
Jamie caught the firefly, put it in a jar
Leighlie is calling, "Jamie, come home"

Then from my window, I can hear them talking
Walking to the crossing in the rain
And over the voices, I can hear the train
That is taking Mister Lincoln to the prairie once again
And over the voices, I can hear the train
That is taking Mister Lincoln to the prairie once again

Lincoln's Train, Lincoln's Train

"Yeah, they said they saw it coming, oh
Four or five miles back, down by the watertower"

"Don't get to close to the tracks
You see, the train can suck you right on up."

"Poor Mister Lincoln, who would do a thing like that!"
"Poor Mister Lincoln, who would do a thing like that!" 
"Poor Mister Lincoln, who would do a thing like that!"
"Poor Mister Lincoln, who would do a thing like that!"

Then from my window, I can hear them talking
Walking to the crossing in the rain
And over the voices, I can hear the train
That is taking Mister Lincoln to the prairie once again
And over the voices, I can hear the train
That is taking Mister Lincoln to the prairie once again
