Note:
G- chord - play notes G,Gb,C,Gb,G,Gb C-A-Gb-G 
or, rent a bass player to do that with you.

If you play this distinctive run in “high mode”,
go for B- and high E-string, 7th and 8th fret, there
the notes are “close together” (sez I).
Of course, us amateurs then can´t play the G-chord
(okay – D on the 7th fret is G. Still difficult.)
Settle for a single-note intro or find someone to
play a second guitar part.
