Oh, I'm still running
Running on the highway line
I am still running, a wild one
Using the Marlon Brando line
I'm still running
And it's easier somehow
Knowing the things that I know now
I'm still running
Running like I always did
Still with the heart of a kid
Heart of a kid

Oh, we're still singing
Singing the songs we've always known
We're still singing, oh even
If we have to sing alone
We're still singing
And it's easier somehow
Knowing the things, that we know now
We're still singing
Singing like we always did
Still with the heart of a kid
Still with the heart of a kid
Still with the heart of a kid
Heart of a kid

We're still hoping
There's hope for me and you
We're still hoping
Oh, that we will see it through
We're still hoping
And it's easier somehow
Knowing the things, that we know now
We're still hoping
Hoping like we always did
Still with the heart of a kid
Still with the heart of a kid
Still with the heart of a kid
Heart of a kid

Oh, I'm still running
Running on the highway line
I am still running, a wild one
Using the Marlon Brando line
I'm still running
And it's easier somehow
Knowing the things that I know now
I'm still running
Running like I always did
Still with the heart of a kid
Heart of a kid
