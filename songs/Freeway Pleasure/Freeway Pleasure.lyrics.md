As long as the tires still cry on the highway
As long as the dogs still die on the road
As long as I wake up without knowing who I am
I will always think of you as home

Every time I hear you say "John why are you leaving?"
Bless it, my confession is a woman called the road
And like the other woman, the road she gets jealous
She knows there'll come a time I won't see her anymore

The road is my woman
And she's never done me wrong
And I'm true to her
The road is my woman
And she's here in this song
And I'm true to her
But not for long

Rescue me sweet angel
She stole me as a child
To become a rider on her two-lane rodeo
And then you came along
Loving me for what I am
I've been too long with a woman made of stone

The road is my woman
And she's never done me wrong
And I'm true to her
The road is my woman
And she's here in this song
And I'm true to her
But not for long

The road is my woman
And she's never done me wrong
And I'm true to her
The road is my woman
And she's here in this song
And I'm true to her
But not for long
