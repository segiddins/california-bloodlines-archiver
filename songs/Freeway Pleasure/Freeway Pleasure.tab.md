(Bm7/A) "John why are you (Am7/G)leaving?"
(G)Bless it, my con(F)fession 
Is a (D)woman called the (Em)road.
(G)Like the other (Am7/G)woman, 
The (Bm7/A)road, she gets (Am7/G)jealous,
She (G)knows there'll (G/Gb)come a (C)time 
I won't (Em/B)see her (G)any(D/Gb)more.

The (C)road is my (Bm)woman
And she's (C)never (D/Gb)done me (Em)wrong,
And I'm (F)true to her.(C)(D/Gb)
The (C)road is my (Bm)woman

And I'm (F)true to her.(C)(D/Gb)   (hold)
But not for (G)lo(Am7/G)ng. (Bm7/A) (Am7/G)

(G)Rescue me, sweet (Am7/G)angel,
She (Bm7/A)stole me as a (Am7/G)child
(G)To become a (F)rider 
On her (D)two-lane rode(Em)o.
And then (G)you came a(Am7/G)long, 
(Bm7/A)Loving me for (Am7/G)what I am,
(G) I've (G/Gb)been too (C)long 
With a (Em/B)woman (G)made of (D/Gb)stone.

The (C)road is my (Bm)woman,
And she's (C)never (D/Gb)done me (Em)wrong,
And I'm (F)true to her.(C)(D/Gb)
The (C)road is my (Bm)woman,
