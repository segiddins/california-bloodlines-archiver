    "Lyrics": "As long as the tires still cry on the highway\nAs long as the dogs still die on the road\nAs long as I wake up without knowing who I am\nI will always think of you as home\n\nEvery time I hear you say \"John why are you leaving?\"\nBless it, my confession is a woman called the road\nAnd like the other woman, the road she gets jealous\nShe knows there'll come a time I won't see her anymore\n\nThe road is my woman\nAnd she's never done me wrong\nAnd I'm true to her\nThe road is my woman\nAnd she's here in this song\nAnd I'm true to her\nBut not for long\n\nRescue me sweet angel\nShe stole me as a child\nTo become a rider on her two-lane rodeo\nAnd then you came along\nLoving me for what I am\nI've been too long with a woman made of stone\n\nThe road is my woman\nAnd she's never done me wrong\nAnd I'm true to her\nThe road is my woman\nAnd she's here in this song\nAnd I'm true to her\nBut not for long\n\nThe road is my woman\nAnd she's never done me wrong\nAnd I'm true to her\nThe road is my woman\nAnd she's here in this song\nAnd I'm true to her\nBut not for long\n\n",
