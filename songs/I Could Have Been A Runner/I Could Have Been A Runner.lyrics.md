Oh I could have been a runner but I never had the speed
Yes, I have me two good legs but that's not all you need
And you know I had the heart for winning, yes indeed
Oh I could have been the runner but I never had the speed

And I could have been a dancer but I never had the style
You can only go so far on costumes and a smile
And I had all the moves, it'll do you for awhile
Oh I could have been a dancer but I never had the style

And all the years, they're starting doing numbers on your fears
Like all the times that I wasted as a pocket full of dimes
Oh, they live on in every tune, but yes I could have sung

Oh, I could have been your lover but I never had a clue
What you'd say to me, or what I'd say to you
But you know I could have loved you, it's the one thing I can do
Oh, I could have been your lover but I never had a clue

And I am the great pretender, living on my dreams
A little short of winning and a little long on schemes
As the dreams of mice and men are pulling at their seams
Oh I am the great pretender who is living on his dreams

Oh I could have been a runner but I never had the speed
