    "Lyrics": "Oh I could have been a runner but I never had the speed\nYes, I have me two good legs but that's not all you need\nAnd you know I had the heart for winning, yes indeed\nOh I could have been the runner but I never had the speed\n\nAnd I could have been a dancer but I never had the style\nYou can only go so far on costumes and a smile\nAnd I had all the moves, it'll do you for awhile\nOh I could have been a dancer but I never had the style\n\nAnd all the years, they're starting doing numbers on your fears\nLike all the times that I wasted as a pocket full of dimes\nOh, they live on in every tune, but yes I could have sung\n\nOh, I could have been your lover but I never had a clue\nWhat you'd say to me, or what I'd say to you\nBut you know I could have loved you, it's the one thing I can do\nOh, I could have been your lover but I never had a clue\n\nAnd I am the great pretender, living on my dreams\nA little short of winning and a little long on schemes\nAs the dreams of mice and men are pulling at their seams\nOh I am the great pretender who is living on his dreams\n\nOh I could have been a runner but I never had the speed\n\n",
