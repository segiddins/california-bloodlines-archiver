Everywhere that I go
Listen to the radio
I wonder why I turned it on
Going to the record store
Nothing does it anymore
I wonder what's going on

Knocking on the stage door
Going to the Troubadour
Looking for the magic song
Sitting in the grandstand
Jumpin' Up's a new band
Tore it up at Madam Wong's

He's the Nightman
He's the Nightman
And there's magic on the bandstand
Rocking with the Nightman home
There's magic on the bandstand
Rocking with the Nightman home
There's magic on the bandstand
Rocking with the Nightman home

And his music made my neck crack
Gotta get your life back
Dancing on a thumb tack
Running on the right track now
There was magic on the bandstand
Hit me in the grandstand
Got me doing handstands
Drummer hit the wham-bam, yeah

And there's magic on the bandstand
Rocking with the Nightman home
There's magic on the bandstand
Rocking with the Nightman home
There's magic on the bandstand
Rocking with the Nightman home
