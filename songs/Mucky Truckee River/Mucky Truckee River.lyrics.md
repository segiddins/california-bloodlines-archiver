Perhaps we waited just too long
With all our euphemistic songs
For the green grass of home
Is all concrete and stone
And there's nothing for the wind
To gather where it's blown

No one reads the papers any more 
They are nothing more than lectures on the war
And those who hold the hope
They just sit and smoke their dope
And they talk of where it's at
And all the books they never wrote

And the mucky Truckee River sings to me
The mucky Truckee River sings to me
Here live the hearts of where you long to be
The mucky Truckee River sings to me

It seems that everyone you meet
Talks about the fighting in the street
But no one has the time
And the patriots you find
Are those pink poodle'd people
Of Sunset and Vine

And the mucky Truckee River sings to me
The mucky Truckee River sings to me
Here live the hearts of where you long to be
The mucky Truckee River sings to me

Perhaps we waited just too long
With all our euphemistic songs
For the green grass of home
Is all concrete and stone
And there's nothing for the wind
To gather where it's blown
