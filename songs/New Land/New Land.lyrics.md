Betsy, Betsy, oh

I had wandered
I was told
There's no use to search for gold
Get you some land
You can call your own
Find the girl that you left back home

I woke in the morning
And I heard the sound
Of rain that was giving it's life to the ground
I breath in the air
Fresh and clear
Thank the Lord for having you near

I had wandered
I was told
There's no use to search for gold
Get you some land
You can call your own
Find the girl that you left back home

I walked toward the hill
Where the sun was to rise
The joy of the land I can see with my eyes
My heart it is filled
With a love that is true
These hands, darling, are working for you.

I had wandered
I was told
There's no use to search for gold
Get you some land
You can call your own
Find the girl that you left back home

Betsy, I'm a coming
I hear you now
There's trees to be cleared and fields to be plowed
And through all the years
Grateful we will be
For a home that is ours and a land that is free

I had wandered
I was told
There's no use to search for gold
Get you some land
You can call your own
Find the girl that you left back home
Find the girl that you left back home
Find the girl that you left back home
