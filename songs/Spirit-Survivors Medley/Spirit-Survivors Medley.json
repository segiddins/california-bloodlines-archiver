    "Lyrics": "Spirit my friend\nCome on and move me\nSpirit my heart lies ready to fly\nAbove the news of the morning street paper\nSpirit my arrow is pulled\nAnd aimed at the sky\n\nSpirit you moved\nOn the land of my father\nCherokee women lie broken and down\nSpirit them on to the land of their brother\nSpirit their mother's own blood\nHas hallowed the ground\n\nOh once it was mother\nAnd God and the country\nAnd once it was flags\nAnd the Forth of July\nBut Spirit the eagle is changing its course\nAnd you know that the horses of war\nFinally die\n\n\nChildren in Cheyenne are taught in their schools\nBelieve in the country, don't break any rules\nBut the T.V. is on and they know something's wrong\nSomeone must tell them to keep pushing on\n\nCan you hear me Wyoming?\nYou are the country\nYou are the nation\nYou will survive\nCan you hear me Wyoming?\nYou are the country\nYou are the nation\nYou will survive\n\nCan you hear me Virginia?\nYou are the country\nYou are the nation\nYou will survive\n\nCan you hear me Dakota?\nCan you hear me in Texas?\nCan you hear me Hawaii?\nCan you hear me Wisconsin?\nCan you hear me California?\nCan you hear me Colorado?\n\nYou are the country\nYou are the nation\nYou will survive\n\n",
