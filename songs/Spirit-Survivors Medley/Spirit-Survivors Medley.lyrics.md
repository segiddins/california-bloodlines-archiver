Spirit my friend
Come on and move me
Spirit my heart lies ready to fly
Above the news of the morning street paper
Spirit my arrow is pulled
And aimed at the sky

Spirit you moved
On the land of my father
Cherokee women lie broken and down
Spirit them on to the land of their brother
Spirit their mother's own blood
Has hallowed the ground

Oh once it was mother
And God and the country
And once it was flags
And the Forth of July
But Spirit the eagle is changing its course
And you know that the horses of war
Finally die


Children in Cheyenne are taught in their schools
Believe in the country, don't break any rules
But the T.V. is on and they know something's wrong
Someone must tell them to keep pushing on

Can you hear me Wyoming?
You are the country
You are the nation
You will survive
Can you hear me Wyoming?
You are the country
You are the nation
You will survive

Can you hear me Virginia?
You are the country
You are the nation
You will survive

Can you hear me Dakota?
Can you hear me in Texas?
Can you hear me Hawaii?
Can you hear me Wisconsin?
Can you hear me California?
Can you hear me Colorado?

You are the country
You are the nation
You will survive
