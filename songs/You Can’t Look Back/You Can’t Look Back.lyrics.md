But you can't look back
When you're moving on
But you can't look back
Buddy you got to go and sing your song

Where did they go
All the good times I used to know?
Long time ago I loved a woman
I loved a woman, never let her know

But you can't look back
When you're moving on
But you can't look back
Buddy you got to go and sing your song

Stumble and fall
I'm not the man that I was at all
Words on the wall, I do believe
I do believe I might have blown it all

But you can't look back
When you're moving on
But you can't look back
Buddy you got to go and sing your song
