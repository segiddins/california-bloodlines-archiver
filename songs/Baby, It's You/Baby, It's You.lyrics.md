And when the stars at night are doing alright
And they sing to me of you
And the moon on the hood
Is doing what it should
And I dream when the moon is new

And baby, it's you
Baby, it's you
Baby, it's you, you, you
Baby, it's you

And I'm still in the spell
Of the night I first fell
And baby, you know that's true
And I'll get my chance
At the Nightingale Dance
When they'll play every song we knew

And baby, it's you
Baby, it's you
Baby, it's you, you
And baby, it's you

And baby, it's you
Baby, it's you
Baby, it's you, you, you
Baby, it's you

And when the clear blue sky
Is falling in my eyes
And there's nothing that I can do
Oh, ´n´ the music is sweet
Down on Cadillac Street
And baby, that's when I knew

That baby, it's you
Baby, it's you
Baby, it's you, you, you
Baby, it's you

And baby, it's you
And baby, it's you
And baby, it's you, you, you
Baby, it's you
