Parochial school uniforms
They don't have any pearls
Any ruffles you can twirl
Just the blue serge pressed against her skin

Parochial school girls
They don't have any thoughts
That they know that they should not
They're afraid that they might die in sin

But I wonder what she thinks about
When her mother's turned her night light out
Covered with her comforter and curls
All American girl
All American girl

She's a blue eyed blonde
And she knows she's a queen
And her life is but a dream
But I wonder what dreams run through her head?

She's a blue eyed blonde
Daddy's girl 
In her heart she's ashamed
'Cause she knows that she has changed
From the dreams that haunt her in her bed

Ah, yes, I wonder what she thinks about
When her mother's turned her night light out
Covered with her comforter and curls
Yes, I wonder what she thinks about
When her mother's turned her night light out
Covered with her comforter and curls
All American girl
All American girl
