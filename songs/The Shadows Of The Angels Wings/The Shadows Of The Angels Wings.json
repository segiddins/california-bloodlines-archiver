    "Lyrics": "Saw some words on a highway sign that just hit me in the chest\nThat seem to say that when things go wrong, that they happen for the best\nSo I grabbed a piece of paper for the words just seem to sing\nThose aren't clouds on the horizon\nThey're the shadows of the Angel's wings\n\nI recall when I was just a boy and my brother and I, well we'd listen through the walls\nAnd heard our father tell our Ma, he'd say those kids are no good at all\nHe said we were less than zero, ah, but it didn't mean a thing\nFor those weren't clouds on the horizon, no\nThey were the shadows of the Angel's wings\nFor those weren't clouds on the horizon\nThe shadows of the Angel's wings\n\nNow I'm grown, I've got children of my own and I'm careful what I say\nFor I know the power that words can have, words you can not take away\nSo what I try to tell them is the secret of the kings\nThose aren't clouds on the horizon, no\nThey're the shadows of the Angel's wings\nThose aren't clouds on the horizon, no\nThey're the shadows of the Angel's wings\n\nPut it in your pocket, keep it with your things\nPut it where their words seep in your soul\nThe secret of the Angel's wings\n\nTimes are hard and thing are tough and money's getting thin\nAnd it seems like there is no way out of here, there is no way to win\nThen I saw that piece of paper in the dirt by the front porch swing\nSaying those aren't clouds on the horizon, no\nThose aren't clouds on the horizon, no\nThose aren't clouds on the horizon, no\nThey're the shadows of the Angel's wings\n\n",
