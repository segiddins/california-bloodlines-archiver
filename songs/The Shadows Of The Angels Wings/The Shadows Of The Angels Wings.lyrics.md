Saw some words on a highway sign that just hit me in the chest
That seem to say that when things go wrong, that they happen for the best
So I grabbed a piece of paper for the words just seem to sing
Those aren't clouds on the horizon
They're the shadows of the Angel's wings

I recall when I was just a boy and my brother and I, well we'd listen through the walls
And heard our father tell our Ma, he'd say those kids are no good at all
He said we were less than zero, ah, but it didn't mean a thing
For those weren't clouds on the horizon, no
They were the shadows of the Angel's wings
For those weren't clouds on the horizon
The shadows of the Angel's wings

Now I'm grown, I've got children of my own and I'm careful what I say
For I know the power that words can have, words you can not take away
So what I try to tell them is the secret of the kings
Those aren't clouds on the horizon, no
They're the shadows of the Angel's wings
Those aren't clouds on the horizon, no
They're the shadows of the Angel's wings

Put it in your pocket, keep it with your things
Put it where their words seep in your soul
The secret of the Angel's wings

Times are hard and thing are tough and money's getting thin
And it seems like there is no way out of here, there is no way to win
Then I saw that piece of paper in the dirt by the front porch swing
Saying those aren't clouds on the horizon, no
Those aren't clouds on the horizon, no
Those aren't clouds on the horizon, no
They're the shadows of the Angel's wings
