Chorus:
If I had wings
Like Noah's doves
Fly up the river
To the one I love
Fare thee well oh Honey
Fare thee well

If I had listened
For what my Mama said
I would not be sleeping 
In my baby's bed
And fare thee well oh Honey
Fare thee well

If I would ride
The Ohio rails
I would not be sitting
In this prison jail
Fare thee well oh Honey
Fare thee well

(Repeat Chorus)
