Don' t look for heros in the morning
Don' t look for heros in the sun
Oh, they will come by night, right before the light
Coming out of nowhere on the run

Listen for the guitar playing fire
Listen for the horseman on the drum
Listen for the sound that'll nail you to the ground
Coming out of nowhere on the run
I'm coming out of nowhere on the run

Coming out of nowhere on the run
I'm coming out of nowhere on the run

Coming out of nowhere on the run
I'm coming out of nowhere on the run
I'm coming out of nowhere on the run
