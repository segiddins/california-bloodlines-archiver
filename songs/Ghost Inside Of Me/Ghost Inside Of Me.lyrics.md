Every prayer I could be praying, every promise I'm betraying
Every price that I am paying, is like a ghost inside of me
Every road I could be taking, every dream I am forsaking
Every heart that's out there breaking, is like a ghost inside of me

Look around, around, look around
Every time I turn around
I'm not who I ought to be
Down, down, it gets me down
If every time I look around
There is something haunting me

Every friend I am deserting, with every danger I am flirting
Every word that ends up hurting, is like a ghost inside of me
Every heart that I could be cheering, every love that I am fearing
Every cry that I am hearing, is like a ghost inside of me

Look around, around, look around
Every time I turn around
I'm not who I ought to be
Down, down, it gets me down
If every time I look around
There is something haunting me

Every tear that I'm not crying, every pain I am denying
Every lie I'm justifying, is like a ghost inside of me
Like a ghost inside of me
Like a ghost inside of me
Like a ghost inside of me
Like a ghost inside of me
