Oh, play me an old song with a good melody
On a barroom piano in the year of fifty three
For I long to go dancing as we did in those days
Oh, Virginia, take me away

And oh, Virginia, take me away
Oh, Virginia, take me away
For my heart is both laughing and crying these days
Oh, Virginia, take me away

And good times are like gold for they shine in the sun
And they brighten your days when you live on the run
And if I were to find you all I would say
Is "Oh, Virginia, take me away"

And oh, Virginia, take me away
Oh, Virginia, take me away
For my heart is both laughing and crying these days
Oh, Virginia, take me away

And oh, Virginia, take me away
Oh, Virginia, take me away
For my heart is both laughing and crying these days
Oh, Virginia, take me away
