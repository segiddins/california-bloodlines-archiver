    "Lyrics": "Oh, play me an old song with a good melody\nOn a barroom piano in the year of fifty three\nFor I long to go dancing as we did in those days\nOh, Virginia, take me away\n\nAnd oh, Virginia, take me away\nOh, Virginia, take me away\nFor my heart is both laughing and crying these days\nOh, Virginia, take me away\n\nAnd good times are like gold for they shine in the sun\nAnd they brighten your days when you live on the run\nAnd if I were to find you all I would say\nIs \"Oh, Virginia, take me away\"\n\nAnd oh, Virginia, take me away\nOh, Virginia, take me away\nFor my heart is both laughing and crying these days\nOh, Virginia, take me away\n\nAnd oh, Virginia, take me away\nOh, Virginia, take me away\nFor my heart is both laughing and crying these days\nOh, Virginia, take me away\n\n",
