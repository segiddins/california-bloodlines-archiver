I want to be Elvis, I want to be Dean
I want to be Elvis in the cool machine
I want to be Elvisback in '55
Singing "Mystery Train" in a Memphis dive

I want to be Elvis, I want to be Dean
I want to be Elvis when the girls all screamed
I want to be Elvis on the Sullivan stage
I want to be Elvis in the glory days
I want to be Elvis when he drove the truck
I want to be Elvis singing "All Shook Up"

Hmmm, Hmmm, Yea, Yea, Yea
Hmmm, Hmmm, Yea, Yea, Yea

I want to be Elvis on a flaming star
I want to be Elvis in the Cadillac car
I want to be Elvis rocking the blues
I want to be Elvis in his blue suede shoes 
I want to be Elvis and I want to be Dean
I want to be Elvis when the girls all scream
If I could be Elvis, won't I be cool
I want to be singing "Don't Be Cruel"
I want to be Elvis, would I think twice
Do I want to be Elvis and pay that price
Do I want to be Elvis and pay that price

Hmmm, Hmmm, Yea, Yea, Yea
Hmmm, Hmmm, Yea, Yea, Yea

I want to be Elvis and I want to be Dean
I want to be Elvis when the girls all scream
I want to be Elvis in the cool machine
I want to be Elvis and I want to be Dean
I want to be Elvis

Hmmm, Hmmm
