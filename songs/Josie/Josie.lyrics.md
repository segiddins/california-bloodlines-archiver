Josie loved the sailors
With their bawdy, wet neck songs
Josie loved the stories
From the halls of the Kublai Khan

And don't you know she loved me
Ah, she loved me all the time
And won't you say hello to Josie
On the San Francisco county line
Oh, say hello to Josie
On the San Francisco county line

Josie loved the soldiers
Coming home from war
Josie used to tell them
That you won't go fight no more

But don't you know she loved me
Ah, she loved me all the time
And won't you say hello to Josie
On the San Francisco county line
Oh, say hello to Josie
On the San Francisco county line

Josie don't work sidewalks
Or the bars of the Tenderloin
'Cause Josie makes her money
From the homesick, lonesome boys

But don't you know she loved me
Ah, she loved me all the time
Say hello to Josie
On the San Francisco county line
Oh, say hello to Josie
On the San Francisco county line
Oh, say hello to Josie
On the San Francisco county line
