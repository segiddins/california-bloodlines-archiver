I ain't afraid of the lightning and rain
When the wind blows from the north
Don't bother me if I'm lost at sea
And my ship blows off its course
Take it from me as the wind blows free
You will know it's true
But what scares me to death
To my dying breath
The wild side of you
Oh, the wild side of you

And I have seen the wicked and the mean
The midnight rider's gun
Taking leave of the bull dog's teeth
When that mother's on the run
Take it from me as the wind blows free
You will know it's true
And what scares me to death
To my dying breath
The wild side of you
Oh, the wild side of you

Stranger still is the bitter pill
That I swallow now and then
The devil says to bend my head
Saying "You ain't no different, friend."
And you will know how the story goes
It's as easy as one, two, three
And what scares me to death
To my dying breath
It's the wild side of me
Ah, the wild side of me

I ain't afraid of the lightning and rain
When the wind blows from the north
Don't bother me if I'm lost at sea
And my ship blows off its course
Take it from me as the wind blows free
You will know it's true
And what scares me to death
To my dying breath
The wild side of you
Oh, the wild side of you
Wild side of you
Wild side of you
