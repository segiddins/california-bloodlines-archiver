Big parade out on 101
Everybody's leaving in the California sun
Up to Santa Monica, down to Highway 10
Going to El Paso and then you come back again

Oh it's evacuation from the promised land
Evacuation, get out while you can
Evacuation, every child, woman, man
Mass evacuation from the promised land

Evacuation from the promised land
Evacuation, every child, woman, man
Evacuation, get out while you can
Mass evacuation from the promised land

Mass evacuation from the promised land
It's mass evacuation from the promised land
