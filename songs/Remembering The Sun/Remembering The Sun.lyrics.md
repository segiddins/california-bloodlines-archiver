On old forgotten altars
The sacrifices lay
Are you looking for a virgin
For they're hard to find these days
Those who took the family
Those who took the cause
Those who took the music
We should stop to give them pause

To be ready and be steady
For the future it will come
And you can survive the darkest night
Remembering the sun

Scholder paints dream horses
While I paint dream lives
Wise man knows the answer
But the dreamer will survive
Time went by so quickly
That I didn't see it go
But I never saw it coming
So how was I to know?

To be ready and be steady
For the future it will come
And you can survive the darkest night
Remembering the sun

Looking to the future
I see myself alone
In the desert, in an Airstream
With a mantra and a phone
And you'd come by to see me
And we'd play the VCR
Stare at who we were
And not at who we are

To be ready and be steady
For the future it will come
And you can survive the darkest night
Remembering the sun
You know you can survive the darkest night
Remembering the sun
Remembering the sun
Remembering the sun
Remembering the sun
