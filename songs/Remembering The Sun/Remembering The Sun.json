    "Lyrics": "On old forgotten altars\nThe sacrifices lay\nAre you looking for a virgin\nFor they're hard to find these days\nThose who took the family\nThose who took the cause\nThose who took the music\nWe should stop to give them pause\n\nTo be ready and be steady\nFor the future it will come\nAnd you can survive the darkest night\nRemembering the sun\n\nScholder paints dream horses\nWhile I paint dream lives\nWise man knows the answer\nBut the dreamer will survive\nTime went by so quickly\nThat I didn't see it go\nBut I never saw it coming\nSo how was I to know?\n\nTo be ready and be steady\nFor the future it will come\nAnd you can survive the darkest night\nRemembering the sun\n\nLooking to the future\nI see myself alone\nIn the desert, in an Airstream\nWith a mantra and a phone\nAnd you'd come by to see me\nAnd we'd play the VCR\nStare at who we were\nAnd not at who we are\n\nTo be ready and be steady\nFor the future it will come\nAnd you can survive the darkest night\nRemembering the sun\nYou know you can survive the darkest night\nRemembering the sun\nRemembering the sun\nRemembering the sun\nRemembering the sun\n\n",
