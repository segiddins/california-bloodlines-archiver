    "Lyrics": "Eagle on the wind\nAnd he shakes his wings\nHe lifts his head\nAnd up he swings\nHe can fly til the winter turns to spring\nBut the high flying eagle cannot sing\n\nEagle lifts his head\nAnd he finds the sky\nShakes his wings\nAnd up he flies\nHe can fly til the winter turns to spring\nBut the high flying eagle cannot sing\n\nI don't know but I thought I could fly\nAnd I won't know. Not until I can try\nStill I know that it won't mean a thing\nThis high flying eagle cannot sing\n\nEagle on the wind\nAnd he shakes his wings\nHe lifts his head\nAnd up he swings\nHe can fly til the winter turns to spring\nBut the high flying eagle cannot sing\n\nI don't know but I thought I could fly\nAnd I won't know. Not until I can try\nStill I know that it won't mean a thing\nThis high flying eagle\nThis high flying eagle\nThis high flying eagle\nThis high flying eagle cannot sing\n\n",
