Eagle on the wind
And he shakes his wings
He lifts his head
And up he swings
He can fly til the winter turns to spring
But the high flying eagle cannot sing

Eagle lifts his head
And he finds the sky
Shakes his wings
And up he flies
He can fly til the winter turns to spring
But the high flying eagle cannot sing

I don't know but I thought I could fly
And I won't know. Not until I can try
Still I know that it won't mean a thing
This high flying eagle cannot sing

Eagle on the wind
And he shakes his wings
He lifts his head
And up he swings
He can fly til the winter turns to spring
But the high flying eagle cannot sing

I don't know but I thought I could fly
And I won't know. Not until I can try
Still I know that it won't mean a thing
This high flying eagle
This high flying eagle
This high flying eagle
This high flying eagle cannot sing
