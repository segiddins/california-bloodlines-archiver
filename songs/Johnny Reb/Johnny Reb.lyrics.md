Listen while I tell ya
'Bout a rebel brave and bold
His name is not important
But his story must be told

He left his home in Caroline
His wife and children three
Left them all behind him
To follow General Lee
General Lee

For he is the symbol
Of those who bore the gun
And died for what they thought was right in 1861
Sixty one

Although his flag was stars and bars
And his uniform was grey
In his heart the cause was just
As he left that summer's day

For he is the symbol
Of those who bore the gun
And died for what they thought was right in 1861
Sixty one

They stopped to rest in Gettysburg
At a hill that lay nearby
Johnny Reb said to his friends
"Here's where I shall die"

The cannon shots rang out
His comrades by him fell
When Johnny heard the bugle call
He gave a rebel yell
(eeeeehaaa)

For he is the symbol
Of those who bore the gun
And died for what they thought was right in 1861
Sixty one

He saw the ridge before him
The enemy in blue
He held his gun before him
As he charged through

Yes, he is the symbol
Of those who bore the gun
And died for what they thought was right in 1861
Sixty one

We buried Johnny
'Neath the willow tree
But, his spirit still lives on
In this land of liberty

For he is the symbol
Of those who bore the gun
And died for what they thought was right in 1861
