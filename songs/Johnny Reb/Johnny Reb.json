    "Lyrics": "Listen while I tell ya\n'Bout a rebel brave and bold\nHis name is not important\nBut his story must be told\n\nHe left his home in Caroline\nHis wife and children three\nLeft them all behind him\nTo follow General Lee\nGeneral Lee\n\nFor he is the symbol\nOf those who bore the gun\nAnd died for what they thought was right in 1861\nSixty one\n\nAlthough his flag was stars and bars\nAnd his uniform was grey\nIn his heart the cause was just\nAs he left that summer's day\n\nFor he is the symbol\nOf those who bore the gun\nAnd died for what they thought was right in 1861\nSixty one\n\nThey stopped to rest in Gettysburg\nAt a hill that lay nearby\nJohnny Reb said to his friends\n\"Here's where I shall die\"\n\nThe cannon shots rang out\nHis comrades by him fell\nWhen Johnny heard the bugle call\nHe gave a rebel yell\n(eeeeehaaa)\n\nFor he is the symbol\nOf those who bore the gun\nAnd died for what they thought was right in 1861\nSixty one\n\nHe saw the ridge before him\nThe enemy in blue\nHe held his gun before him\nAs he charged through\n\nYes, he is the symbol\nOf those who bore the gun\nAnd died for what they thought was right in 1861\nSixty one\n\nWe buried Johnny\n'Neath the willow tree\nBut, his spirit still lives on\nIn this land of liberty\n\nFor he is the symbol\nOf those who bore the gun\nAnd died for what they thought was right in 1861\n\n",
