    "Lyrics": "I still can remember Pa coming home drunk\nWith the boys from the Union Hall station\nAnd it's hard to believe all the words that I read\nWe are living in God's favourite nation\nAnd I knew he was ill from the size of his pills\nBut he choked on the preacher's salvation\nAnd I know that his blood it still flows in my veins\nAs I fall for each blue-eyed temptation\n\nAnd the razorback woman who stood by his side\nIs skinny and fixing to die\nOh the razorback woman is calling me home\nAnd she cries\nOh my God how she cries\n\nI was only fourteen and my Dad he was mean\nWhen his face shined a river of sweat\nOh, he started yelling \"You'll go straight to hell\"\nAnd \"You're young and your ears are still wet\"\nWhen the other young boys were enjoying their toys\nHe gave me my first cigarette\nAnd I'd like to say that these were the days\nThat my sprung lungs will never forget\n\nAnd the razorback woman who stood by his side\nIs skinny and fixing to die\nOh the razorback woman is calling me home\nAnd she cries\nOh my God how she cries\n\n",
