I still can remember Pa coming home drunk
With the boys from the Union Hall station
And it's hard to believe all the words that I read
We are living in God's favourite nation
And I knew he was ill from the size of his pills
But he choked on the preacher's salvation
And I know that his blood it still flows in my veins
As I fall for each blue-eyed temptation

And the razorback woman who stood by his side
Is skinny and fixing to die
Oh the razorback woman is calling me home
And she cries
Oh my God how she cries

I was only fourteen and my Dad he was mean
When his face shined a river of sweat
Oh, he started yelling "You'll go straight to hell"
And "You're young and your ears are still wet"
When the other young boys were enjoying their toys
He gave me my first cigarette
And I'd like to say that these were the days
That my sprung lungs will never forget

And the razorback woman who stood by his side
Is skinny and fixing to die
Oh the razorback woman is calling me home
And she cries
Oh my God how she cries
