Some will rise, some will fall
Some will run and some will crawl
Some will laugh, some will cry
Some will live, some will die

Some are kind, some are cruel
Some will serve and some will rule
Some will stand, some will kneel
Some will curse, some will heal

We're the people in the mirror, we're the people in the light
We're the people in the morning, we're the people in the night
We're the people of the heartland, we're the people on the train
We're the people in the mirror, and the people are the same
We're the people in the mirror, and the people are the same

Some will take, some will give
Some will blame, some will forgive
Some are wise, some are fools
Some are stones, some are jewels

We're the people in the mirror, we're the people in the light
We're the people in the morning, we're the people in the night
We're the people of the heartland, we're the people on the train
We're the people in the mirror, and the people are the same
We're the people in the mirror, and the people are the same

We're the people in the mirror, and the people are the same
We're the people in the mirror, and the people are the same
We're the people in the mirror, and the people are the same
We're the people in the mirror, and the people are the same
We're the people in the mirror, and the people are the same
We're the people in the mirror
