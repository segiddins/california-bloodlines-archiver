White babies and roses
White babies and roses
White babies and roses
On that long straight highway to the sea

Golden pony's from Harlem
Golden pony's from stardom
Golden pony's from Harlem
On that long straight highway to the sea

Silver circus from Shilo
Sheila works in Ohio
There she plays her piano
On that long straight highway to the sea

Flaming queens and ice cold showers
Monkey shows and neon flowers
TV in desperate hours
On that long straight highway to the sea

Coca Colas at twilight
Topless strippers in barlight
Big tippers in all white
On that long straight highway to the sea

Cheep sundowns in Fairlane
Steep rundowns with no names
Sleeping clowns playing Coltrane
On that long straight highway to the sea

Flaming queens and ice cold showers
Monkey shows and neon flowers
TV in desperate hours
On that long straight highway to the sea

Apparitions
Blue Madonna's and Honey Lamb
Recognition of Kukla Fran
On that long straight highway to the sea

White babies and roses
White babies and roses
White babies and roses
On that long straight highway to the sea
