    "Lyrics": "No one has a number\nNo one has an address\nMiss Stephanie Butler is gone\nBut I remember those\nDays at Seven Oaks\nWhen love was a word among those you'ld never chose\n\nFor Auld Lang Syne, my dear\nFor Auld Lang Syne\nOh we'll take a cup of kindness yet\nFor Auld Lang Syne\n\nAnd you, Angel Rain\nNeed I explain\nThat you're meaning to me more and more\nLike no one before\nYou've opened the door\nAnd the sun shines down on my heart once more\n\nFor Auld Lang Syne, my dear\nFor Auld Lang Syne\nWe'll take a cup of kindness yet\nFor Auld Lang Syne\n\nAnd you, Thomas Waits\nWhen you pass heaven's gates\nMay that give you the keys to the bar\nWith some old piano\nAnd the waitress sings soprano\nAnd please can you leave my name at the door\n\nAnd Julie hold the fort\nFor the years are getting short\nThey can go with the wave of a hand\nAnd as time goes flying on\nFor all that went wrong\nI wish for you the best and to join us in this song\n\nFor Auld Lang Syne, my dear\nFor Auld Lang Syne\nOh we'll take a cup of kindness yet\nFor Auld Lang Syne\n\nAnd to my dearest friends\nOh how good it has been\nAnd it kills me each day I'm away\nOh to Amy and Mikael\nAnd Jeremy I say\nForever in my heart you will stay\n\nFor Auld Lang Syne, my dear\nFor Auld Lang Syne\nOh we'll take a cup of kindness yet\nFor Auld Lang Syne\n\n",
