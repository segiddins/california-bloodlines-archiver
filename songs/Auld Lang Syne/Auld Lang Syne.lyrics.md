No one has a number
No one has an address
Miss Stephanie Butler is gone
But I remember those
Days at Seven Oaks
When love was a word among those you'ld never chose

For Auld Lang Syne, my dear
For Auld Lang Syne
Oh we'll take a cup of kindness yet
For Auld Lang Syne

And you, Angel Rain
Need I explain
That you're meaning to me more and more
Like no one before
You've opened the door
And the sun shines down on my heart once more

For Auld Lang Syne, my dear
For Auld Lang Syne
We'll take a cup of kindness yet
For Auld Lang Syne

And you, Thomas Waits
When you pass heaven's gates
May that give you the keys to the bar
With some old piano
And the waitress sings soprano
And please can you leave my name at the door

And Julie hold the fort
For the years are getting short
They can go with the wave of a hand
And as time goes flying on
For all that went wrong
I wish for you the best and to join us in this song

For Auld Lang Syne, my dear
For Auld Lang Syne
Oh we'll take a cup of kindness yet
For Auld Lang Syne

And to my dearest friends
Oh how good it has been
And it kills me each day I'm away
Oh to Amy and Mikael
And Jeremy I say
Forever in my heart you will stay

For Auld Lang Syne, my dear
For Auld Lang Syne
Oh we'll take a cup of kindness yet
For Auld Lang Syne
