Faith is what you know it is
Faith is not a lie
Dreams can be whatever dreams can be
Shining in your eyes
When you're gone or you're there
When every step you take is an answer to your prayer
Somewhere over the rainbow
Your destiny lies there

After years in the wilderness, you will find your shining star
After years in the wilderness, you will find your shining star

Hope it is, what you hope it is
Hope will see you through
You've got to love the search, got to love the road
To make your dreams come true
When you're gone or you're there
When every step you take is an answer to your prayer
Somewhere over the rainbow
Your destiny lies there

After years in the wilderness, you will find your shining star
After years in the wilderness, you will find your shining star

Time, it is burning, follow the star
Time, it is a journey, and it is not that far 

After years in the wilderness, you will find your shining star
After years in the wilderness, you will find your shining star
After years in the wilderness, you will find your shining star
After years in the wilderness, you will find your shining star
