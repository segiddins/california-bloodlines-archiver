    "Lyrics": "Faith is what you know it is\nFaith is not a lie\nDreams can be whatever dreams can be\nShining in your eyes\nWhen you're gone or you're there\nWhen every step you take is an answer to your prayer\nSomewhere over the rainbow\nYour destiny lies there\n\nAfter years in the wilderness, you will find your shining star\nAfter years in the wilderness, you will find your shining star\n\nHope it is, what you hope it is\nHope will see you through\nYou've got to love the search, got to love the road\nTo make your dreams come true\nWhen you're gone or you're there\nWhen every step you take is an answer to your prayer\nSomewhere over the rainbow\nYour destiny lies there\n\nAfter years in the wilderness, you will find your shining star\nAfter years in the wilderness, you will find your shining star\n\nTime, it is burning, follow the star\nTime, it is a journey, and it is not that far \n\nAfter years in the wilderness, you will find your shining star\nAfter years in the wilderness, you will find your shining star\nAfter years in the wilderness, you will find your shining star\nAfter years in the wilderness, you will find your shining star\n\n",
