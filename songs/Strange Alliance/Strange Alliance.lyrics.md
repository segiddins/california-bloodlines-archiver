If you're with me on this and it all came from God
Right down from the lightening to the lightening rod
I said it all came from God, the crooked and the level
Black and white, Christ and the Devil

Well they say He decided to make it a game
And He gave them all faces, He gave them all names
He said "We going to do it, let's do it nice"
And he appointed the captains, the Devil and Christ

Like heavyweight champs after the fight
Does Christ hang out with the Devil tonight? Yeah, yeah

Well Christ said to the Devil "You got the first hit
You gave the apple to Eve but it was Adam who bit"
And the Devil said to Christ "Yeah I learned how to fake it
You be surprised what they'll take from a snake yeah"

Christ said to the Devil "Are you pulling no rug?
You never said that you'd come up with drugs"
"Heroine was cool" he said "Cocaine was fact
I did some refining and I'm calling it crack"

"It all works for me" the Devil just smiled
Picking his teeth with the bones of a child

Like heavyweight champs after the fight
Does Christ hang out with the Devil tonight? 
Does Christ hang out with the Devil tonight? Yeah, yeah

The Devil said to Christ "Let's just see how it ends
To tell you the truth, I don't have any friends
'Cause I'm in it for the money, in it for the fame
They don't give a damn who flies the flame"

The Devil said to Christ "The best part of the game
Are all of the people that I kill in your name"

Like heavyweight champs after the fight
Does Christ hang out with the Devil tonight? 
Does Christ hang out with the Devil tonight? Yeah, yeah

Like heavyweight champs after the fight
Does Christ hang out with the Devil tonight? 

Like heavyweight champs after the fight
Does Christ hang out with the Devil tonight?  Yeah, yeah
