Gold out there
Out in California
Get you a map
To the Dutchman Mine
Pickin' up gold
With our bare hands, baby
When we got there
It was stone bone dry

Easy money
It's a hard life, baby
All in all

Loafin' around
Smokin' and drinking
Woke up this morning
And you didn't have a dime
Out on the street
Do you some dealin'
Your best friend, baby
Was the police all the time

Easy money
It's a hard life, baby
All in all

Got yourself, yes
A rich man, baby
Buys you everything
That your little heart desires
Lots of clothes
Trips to Mexico
Everybody knows
That he can't light your fire

Easy money
It's a hard life, baby

Easy money
It's a hard life, baby
All in all
