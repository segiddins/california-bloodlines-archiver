    "Lyrics": "When you sit and wonder\nWhy things have gone so wrong\nAnd you wish someone would tell us\nWhere our friend has gone\n\nLook then to the hills\nWhen there's courage in the wind\nAnd in the face of freedom\nAnd those who look to him\n\nAnd search within the heart\nOf every young man with a song\nThen I think we'll know\nWhere our friend has gone\n\nSummer takes the winter\nAs the good years take the pain\nThere'll be laughter in the land again\nBut, hearts won't be the same\n\nAnd I know I'll remember\nWhen a chill wind takes the sky\nAnd speak of years he gave us hope\nThey will never die\n\nAs we gaze at brave young men\nWhen yesterdays grow long\nThen I think we'll know\nWhere are friend has gone\n\nWhen you sit and wonder\nWhy things have gone so wrong\nIt's then that we'll remember\nWhere our friend has gone\n\n",
