    "Lyrics": "I'm worried about you\nAnd I'm worried about me\nThe curves around midnight\nAren't easy to see\nThe flashing red warning\nUnseen in the rain\nThis thing has turned into\nA runaway train\n\nLong distance phone calls\nThere's a voice on the line\nElectrical miles that soften the time\nAnd dynamite too is hooked on the wire\nSo are the rails of American flyers\n\nBlind boys and gamblers\nThey invented the blues\nWe'll pay up in blood\nWhen this marker comes due\nTo try and get off now\nIs about as insane\nAs those who wave lanterns\nAt runaway trains\nThis thing has turned into\nA runaway train\n\nOh, steel rails and heartlines\nThey are always in twos\nI have been here before, yeah\nAnd now it's with you\n\nI'm worried about you\nAnd I'm worried about me\nWe're lighting the fuses\nAnd counting to three\nWhat are the choices\nFor those who remain?\nThe sign of the cross\nOr the runaway train?\nThis thing has turned into\nA runaway train\n\nOur love has turned into\nA runaway train\n\n",
