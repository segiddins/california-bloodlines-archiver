  dum- deedee doo, dum- deedee doo)

This intro is played 4 x. Please muffle the strings, ladies and gentlemen.
Adding a G-note (empty G-string)
as every second note will let you have a fuller sound. 
Fourth time around, the (G) is on “worried” in the first line.

Or simply play the chords, use mainly “low” strings:

More intro and verse:

This is close to the “Punch” intro and first verse.
Feel free to edit and be sure to muffle.

I can't seem to make the tabs line up
so I tried notes.  This is not that hard to
play but it's hell to transcribe.
