I'm worried about you
And I'm worried about me
The curves around midnight
Aren't easy to see
The flashing red warning
Unseen in the rain
This thing has turned into
A runaway train

Long distance phone calls
There's a voice on the line
Electrical miles that soften the time
And dynamite too is hooked on the wire
So are the rails of American flyers

Blind boys and gamblers
They invented the blues
We'll pay up in blood
When this marker comes due
To try and get off now
Is about as insane
As those who wave lanterns
At runaway trains
This thing has turned into
A runaway train

Oh, steel rails and heartlines
They are always in twos
I have been here before, yeah
And now it's with you

I'm worried about you
And I'm worried about me
We're lighting the fuses
And counting to three
What are the choices
For those who remain?
The sign of the cross
Or the runaway train?
This thing has turned into
A runaway train

Our love has turned into
A runaway train
