Time in Bolinas is so very small
The clock on the courthouse ain't working at all
And the Mayor of Bolinas is digging for clams
But folks in Bolinas
They don't give a damn

Two little figures far down the road
Chasing the trains as far as they go
But the train disappears in it's own westward dot
And the two little figures now stand on the spot
Where all that mighty iron had rolled
And the track now is cold

When the world was spinning a song
And it whistled the wind
Carry it on
When the world was spinning a song
And it whistled the wind
Carry it on

Time in Bolinas is so very small

When the world was spinning a song
And it whistled the wind
Carry it on
When the world was spinning a song
And it whistled the wind
Carry it on

Time in Bolinas is so very small
The clock on the courthouse ain't working at all
And the Mayor of Bolinas is digging for clams
But folks in Bolinas
They don't give a damn
