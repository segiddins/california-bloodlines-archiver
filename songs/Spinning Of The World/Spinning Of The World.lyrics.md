Is it wrong to be so much in love with a girl
That you can't tell her voice from the spinning of the world

I'm gone, I can fly, like a comet on the sky
Looking for the shelter of a hurricane's eye
If I turn the corner and your face, it isn't there
I'll come running back tomorrow and go searching everywhere

Is it wrong to be so much in love with a girl
That you can' t tell her voice from the spinning of the world

The sunset is red, I remember what you said
There's no rest for the weary, I'd be better off dead
I cannot find any words that'll rhyme
My eyes they can see but it feels like I'm blind

Is it wrong to be so much in love with a girl
That you can't tell her voice from the spinning of the world

Is it wrong to be so much in love with a girl
That you can' t tell her voice from the spinning of the world

Is it wrong to be so much in love with a girl
That you can' t tell her voice from the spinning of the world
