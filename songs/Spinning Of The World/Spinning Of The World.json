    "Lyrics": "Is it wrong to be so much in love with a girl\nThat you can't tell her voice from the spinning of the world\n\nI'm gone, I can fly, like a comet on the sky\nLooking for the shelter of a hurricane's eye\nIf I turn the corner and your face, it isn't there\nI'll come running back tomorrow and go searching everywhere\n\nIs it wrong to be so much in love with a girl\nThat you can' t tell her voice from the spinning of the world\n\nThe sunset is red, I remember what you said\nThere's no rest for the weary, I'd be better off dead\nI cannot find any words that'll rhyme\nMy eyes they can see but it feels like I'm blind\n\nIs it wrong to be so much in love with a girl\nThat you can't tell her voice from the spinning of the world\n\nIs it wrong to be so much in love with a girl\nThat you can' t tell her voice from the spinning of the world\n\nIs it wrong to be so much in love with a girl\nThat you can' t tell her voice from the spinning of the world\n\n",
