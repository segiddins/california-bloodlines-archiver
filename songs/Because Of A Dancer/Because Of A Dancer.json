    "Lyrics": "Because of a Dancer,\nThe moon’s on my shoulder\nBecause of a Dancer,\nI\"m waltzing through time\nAnd part of the answer\nIs I’m getting no older\nBecause of a Dancer,\nI am holding the line.\n\nBecause of a Dancer,\nI’m playing with angels\nBecause of a Dancer,\nThey have turned on the light\nBecause of a Dancer,\nOh I know where the rain goes\nBecause of a Dancer,\nI am feeling alright.\n\nChorus:\nAnd if it all comes down,\nTo the whim of an angel,\nAnd if it all comes down\nTo the toss of a coin\nAnd as we all go around,\nWe all get entangled,\nBecause of a Dancer,\nThe circle is joined.\n\nBecause of a Dancer,\nI’m laughing at shadows\nBecause of a Dancer,\nAnd all the good times\nBecause of a Dancer,\nThere is no bastinado\nBecause of a Dancer,\nI’m waltzing through time.\n\n(Repeat Chorus)\n\n",
