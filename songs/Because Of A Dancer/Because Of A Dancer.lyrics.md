Because of a Dancer,
The moon’s on my shoulder
Because of a Dancer,
I"m waltzing through time
And part of the answer
Is I’m getting no older
Because of a Dancer,
I am holding the line.

Because of a Dancer,
I’m playing with angels
Because of a Dancer,
They have turned on the light
Because of a Dancer,
Oh I know where the rain goes
Because of a Dancer,
I am feeling alright.

Chorus:
And if it all comes down,
To the whim of an angel,
And if it all comes down
To the toss of a coin
And as we all go around,
We all get entangled,
Because of a Dancer,
The circle is joined.

Because of a Dancer,
I’m laughing at shadows
Because of a Dancer,
And all the good times
Because of a Dancer,
There is no bastinado
Because of a Dancer,
I’m waltzing through time.

(Repeat Chorus)
