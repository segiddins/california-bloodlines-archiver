G4/C

    E-------3----------------
    B-1----------------------  this is the "4" part
    G------------------------
    D------------------------
    A-------3---------------- this is the "/C" part. 
    E------(3)---------------                                            
 Instead of the "normal" bass note "G" (the root) or the other
 normal bass notes for the G-chord, which are "B" or "D", a "C"
 is played here. I use this way of indicating bass notes also for 
 "normal" bass notes when they´re part of a bass run.
