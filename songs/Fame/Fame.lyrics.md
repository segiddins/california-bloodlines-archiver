Fame takes no prisoners

Well, it kills you if you can, it kills you if you don't
It kills you if you sell your soul and it kills you if you won't
It kills you coming up, kills you going down
Kills the movie actor and it kills the circus clown

Fame takes no prisoners
Fame takes no prisoners
Fame takes no prisoners
Fame takes no prisoners

Well, it kills you if you're smart and it kills you if you're dumb
It kills you on the flip side and it kills you on the come
It kills when you're rising and it kills you when you fall
It kills you when you're not looking, that's when it kills you most of all
