Anna on a memory
She comes rollin' by
Anna on a memory
Makes me laugh, she makes me cry
Makes me think of all the good times
Like a bluebird learn to fly

Blackballed in Abilene
But the morning looked the same
Blackballed in Abilene
And I woke up on a train
Lookin' at the stray dogs
Running on the highway in the rain

Oh, run, dog, run
You won't catch the sun
But you can try
Run, dog, run
You'll just catch that semi rollin' by
I see that you caught the back wheels
That's how all us stray dogs gonna die

Oh, Anna on a memory
She comes rollin' by
Anna on a memory
Makes me laugh, she makes me cry
Makes me think of all the good times
Like a bluebird learn to fly

She makes me think of all the good times
Like a bluebird learn to fly
