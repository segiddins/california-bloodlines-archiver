Leighlie's living on the farm she was born on
Leighlie's clothes were torn from the morn they were first worn
And she stands by the window
Watches by the door
Asking "Is there anybody going to the store?"

The wind blows threw the cracks in the walls of the tool shack
Leighlie holds the sacks as they bring all the grain back
And she works 'till the sun
Is sinking from the sky
I've never heard her laugh and I've never seen her cry

Nebraska widow, only a girl
Nebraska widow, yet this is her world
Nebraska widow, she's living and dying in its whirl
Nebraska widow, only a girl
Nebraska widow, yet this is her world
Nebraska widow, she's living and dying in its whirl

Leighlie's living on the farm she was born on
Leighlie's clothes were torn from the morn they were first worn
And she stands by the window
Watches by the door
Asking "Is there anybody going to the store?"
