There was something in the moving train,
(Bm)Whistles in the pouring rain,
(D)Someone even calls your (G)name,
I am (A)gone.
And there´s (D)something in the sound of drums,
In the (Bm)rhythm as the river runs,
(D)Tells me you're the only (G)one
Here for (A7 short)me.

So I (Bm/F#)sing to the (G)river,
And I (Bm/F#)cling to the (G)river,
And I (Em)bring you the (A)river
Running (Bm/F#)free. (single notes on B-string: 
c# hammer on d-c# hammer on d-c#  b-d-e-c#-f#(on high E),
last note already on…)

(D)  (A)  (G) (A7 short) (D) (bass run D-D-E-D-B-A-B-A-F#-E-D)

There was something in the Southern sky,
In the (Bm)circle where the eagle flies,
(D)Wishing it was you and (G)I
On the (A)run
And there´s (D)something that I can't explain.
It´s the (Bm)something in the moving train,
Like the (D)river and the pouring (G)rain,
We are (A7 short)one.

So I (Bm/F#)cling to the (G)river,
As I (Bm/F#)sing to the (G)river,
And I (Em)bring you the (A)river
Running (Bm/F#)free. (single notes on B-string:
c#-c#, D bass-note, d-c# on B-string again)

And I (Bm/F#)sing, yeah, to the (G)river
And I (Bm/F#)cling, oh, to the (G)river
And I (Em)bring you the (A)river
Running (D)free.
       (A) (G) (A7 short) (D) (bass run D-D-E-D-B-A-B-A-F#-E-D)
