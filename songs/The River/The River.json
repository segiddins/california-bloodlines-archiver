    "Lyrics": "There is something in a moving train\nWhistles in a pouring rain\nIf someone even calls your name\nI am gone.\n\nThere is something in the sound of drums\nIn the rhythm as the river runs\nTells me you’re the only one\nHere for me\n\nChorus:\n\nSo I sing to the river\nAs I cling to the river\nAs I bring you the river\nRunning free\n\nThere is something in a southern sky\nIn the circle where the eagle flies\nI’m wishing it was you and I\nOn the run\n\nThere is something that I can’t explain\nLike the rhythm of a moving train\nLike the river and the pouring rain\nWe are one\n\n(Repeat Chorus 3 times)\n\n\n",
