There is something in a moving train
Whistles in a pouring rain
If someone even calls your name
I am gone.

There is something in the sound of drums
In the rhythm as the river runs
Tells me you’re the only one
Here for me

Chorus:

So I sing to the river
As I cling to the river
As I bring you the river
Running free

There is something in a southern sky
In the circle where the eagle flies
I’m wishing it was you and I
On the run

There is something that I can’t explain
Like the rhythm of a moving train
Like the river and the pouring rain
We are one

(Repeat Chorus 3 times)
