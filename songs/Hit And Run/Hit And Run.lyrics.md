I was looking at the sun
Pardon me
I didn’t know it can’t be done
I was looking at the sun
I was looking at the sun

And I was calling back my youth
Pardon me
Did you want to use the booth?
I was calling back my youth
I was calling back my youth

I don’t listen to the fools
Who are making all the rules
I’m having too much fun
Doing what I want
That I hit and run
Doing what I want
That I hit and run
Hit and run
Hit and run

You are looking for the truth
Pardon me
I think your poodle’s on the roof
You are looking for the truth
You are looking for the truth

So my world is made of paint
Pardon me
I didn’t know that you’re a saint
So my world was made of paint
So my world was made of paint

 I don’t listen to the fools
Who are making all the rules
I’m having too much fun
Doing what I want
That I hit and run
Doing what I want
That I hit and run
Hit and run
Hit and run

I may never be that good
Pardon me
I never said I ever would
I may never be that good
I may never be that good

I was looking at the sun
Pardon me
I didn’t know it can’t be done
I was looking at the sun
I was looking at the sun

I don’t listen to the fools
Who are making all the rules
I’m having too much fun
Doing what I want
That I hit and run
Doing what I want
That I hit and run
Hit and run
Hit and run
