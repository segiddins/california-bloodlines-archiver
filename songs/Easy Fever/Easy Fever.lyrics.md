Night winds across the floor
Remind me of that girl in Baltimore
Cause she's an easy fever
Easy fever

Hot nights and holy sin
What you do just does me in
Cause you're easy fever
Easy fever

Easy fever warm me

Drive me home I want to smell your hair
Stay forever I don't care
Cause you're easy fever
Easy fever

Easy fever warm me
Easy fever there ain't no way that I can leave her
Easy fever warm me

Scarlet woman, magic hands
Make me glad that I'm a man
Cause you're easy fever
Easy fever

Easy fever warm me

Night winds across the floor
Remind me of that girl in Baltimore
Cause she's an easy fever
Easy fever
Easy fever
Easy fever
