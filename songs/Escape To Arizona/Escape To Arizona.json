    "Lyrics": "All say stars of the southern side, call the boys with cellos\nTo raise the windows of southern rooms, in search for lines of yellow\nAs the sunshine flickers, the firefly fades in the distant trees\nThe inner voice of the lonely boy, is the only sound that still reveals\n\nSo you burn my eyes, when the moon sun flies\nLet me dance in their corona\nAnd send me down a highway sign\nEscape to Arizona\n\nSlaughtered hounds on 604, the martyrs of Wingina\nWill never see the desert sun, or the hills of Carolina\nSo look both ways before you cross, take the speed of eagles\nFor the shadow where the watchman hides, is a refuge for illegals\n\nSo you burn my eyes, when the moon sun flies\nLet me dance in their corona\nAnd send me down a highway sign\nEscape to Arizona\n\nBoys who sit in corner rooms and stare at empty pages\nAre doomed to carry canvas bags and suffer workman's wages\nAnd the virgin of the endless roads watches over strangers\nCalls to boys in southern rooms and blinds them to the dangers\n\nSo you burn my eyes, when the moon sun flies\nLet me dance in their corona\nAnd send me down a highway sign\nEscape to Arizona\n\n",
