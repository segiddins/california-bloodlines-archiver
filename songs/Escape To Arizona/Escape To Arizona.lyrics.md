All say stars of the southern side, call the boys with cellos
To raise the windows of southern rooms, in search for lines of yellow
As the sunshine flickers, the firefly fades in the distant trees
The inner voice of the lonely boy, is the only sound that still reveals

So you burn my eyes, when the moon sun flies
Let me dance in their corona
And send me down a highway sign
Escape to Arizona

Slaughtered hounds on 604, the martyrs of Wingina
Will never see the desert sun, or the hills of Carolina
So look both ways before you cross, take the speed of eagles
For the shadow where the watchman hides, is a refuge for illegals

So you burn my eyes, when the moon sun flies
Let me dance in their corona
And send me down a highway sign
Escape to Arizona

Boys who sit in corner rooms and stare at empty pages
Are doomed to carry canvas bags and suffer workman's wages
And the virgin of the endless roads watches over strangers
Calls to boys in southern rooms and blinds them to the dangers

So you burn my eyes, when the moon sun flies
Let me dance in their corona
And send me down a highway sign
Escape to Arizona
