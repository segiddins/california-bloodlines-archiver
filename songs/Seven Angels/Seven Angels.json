    "Lyrics": "Oh raging with the light, the morning comes to slay the night alone\nOh raging with the light, the morning comes to slay the night alone\nSlay the night alone\nSomething caught my eye\n'Cause I thought I saw the seven Angels blazing in the sky\nOh, I thought I saw the seven Angels blazing in the sky\nComing out of the sky\nComing out of the sky\n\nAnd if it all was only water, we would be the rain\nYou can see your sons and daughters flourishing the cane\nAnd as we have been here before, we will come again\nIf it all was water, we are the rain\nWe are the rain, we are the rain\n\nOh raging with the light, the morning comes to slay the night alone\nOh raging with the light, the morning comes to slay the night alone\nSlay the night alone\nSomething caught my eye\n'Cause I thought I saw the seven Angels blazing in the sky\nOh, I thought I saw the seven Angels blazing in the sky\nComing out of the sky\nComing out of the sky\n\nAnd if it was a desert island, we would be the sand\nCan you tell the difference in the woman and the man\nOh there is only one of us but we have many hands\nIf it all was an island, we are the sand\nThen we are the sand, we are the rain\n\nOh raging with the light, the morning comes to slay the night alone\nOh raging with the light, the morning comes to slay the night alone\nSlay the night alone\nSomething caught my eye\nAnd I thought I saw the seven Angels blazing in the sky\nOh, I thought I saw the seven Angels blazing in the sky\nComing out of the sky\nComing out of the sky\n\n",
