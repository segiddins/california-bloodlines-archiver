Oh raging with the light, the morning comes to slay the night alone
Oh raging with the light, the morning comes to slay the night alone
Slay the night alone
Something caught my eye
'Cause I thought I saw the seven Angels blazing in the sky
Oh, I thought I saw the seven Angels blazing in the sky
Coming out of the sky
Coming out of the sky

And if it all was only water, we would be the rain
You can see your sons and daughters flourishing the cane
And as we have been here before, we will come again
If it all was water, we are the rain
We are the rain, we are the rain

Oh raging with the light, the morning comes to slay the night alone
Oh raging with the light, the morning comes to slay the night alone
Slay the night alone
Something caught my eye
'Cause I thought I saw the seven Angels blazing in the sky
Oh, I thought I saw the seven Angels blazing in the sky
Coming out of the sky
Coming out of the sky

And if it was a desert island, we would be the sand
Can you tell the difference in the woman and the man
Oh there is only one of us but we have many hands
If it all was an island, we are the sand
Then we are the sand, we are the rain

Oh raging with the light, the morning comes to slay the night alone
Oh raging with the light, the morning comes to slay the night alone
Slay the night alone
Something caught my eye
And I thought I saw the seven Angels blazing in the sky
Oh, I thought I saw the seven Angels blazing in the sky
Coming out of the sky
Coming out of the sky
