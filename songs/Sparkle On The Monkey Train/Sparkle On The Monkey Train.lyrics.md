Oh life just isn’t what it seems
It seldom lines up with your dreams
It’s something like a cool machine
It’s always hard to keep it clean
And there’s some things you can’t explain
Like Sparkle on the Monkey train

And it’s like the old man never learns
That he’s already had his turn
And like the fire always burns
And it’s like the old man never learns
And there’s some things you can’t explain
Like Sparkle on the Monkey train

Lucky Johnny lost his mind
And he lost his way and he lost his time
Lost true north and the silver lining
When Lucky Johnny lost his mind
And there’s some things you can’t explain
Like Sparkle on the Monkey train

And no one ever says the words
About the thinning of the herd
To ensure survival of the breed
Push the old one’s out with lines to feed
And nothing will remain the same
In the Sparkles on the Monkey train

Life just isn’t what it seems
What seldom lines up with our dreams
Just like a cool machine
It’s always hard to keep it clean
And nothing will remain the same
Sparkle on the Monkey train
Some things just can’t be the same
Sparkle on the monkey train
Some things are as right as rain
Sparkle on the monkey train
