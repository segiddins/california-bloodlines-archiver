    "Lyrics": "Oh life just isn’t what it seems\nIt seldom lines up with your dreams\nIt’s something like a cool machine\nIt’s always hard to keep it clean\nAnd there’s some things you can’t explain\nLike Sparkle on the Monkey train\n\nAnd it’s like the old man never learns\nThat he’s already had his turn\nAnd like the fire always burns\nAnd it’s like the old man never learns\nAnd there’s some things you can’t explain\nLike Sparkle on the Monkey train\n\nLucky Johnny lost his mind\nAnd he lost his way and he lost his time\nLost true north and the silver lining\nWhen Lucky Johnny lost his mind\nAnd there’s some things you can’t explain\nLike Sparkle on the Monkey train\n\nAnd no one ever says the words\nAbout the thinning of the herd\nTo ensure survival of the breed\nPush the old one’s out with lines to feed\nAnd nothing will remain the same\nIn the Sparkles on the Monkey train\n\nLife just isn’t what it seems\nWhat seldom lines up with our dreams\nJust like a cool machine\nIt’s always hard to keep it clean\nAnd nothing will remain the same\nSparkle on the Monkey train\nSome things just can’t be the same\nSparkle on the monkey train\nSome things are as right as rain\nSparkle on the monkey train\n\n",
