Lights of the city
Like jewels in the night
Their music is the siren and the scream
Faces in the city
Won’t look you in the eye
The faces of the wounded and the mean

Shadows on the highway
Ravens In the yard
Who is that coming this way?
Dealers in the school yard
In a West Virginia town
How did things ever, ever get this way?

Chorus:

American nights, Ameri-can days
American nights, American days

A young mans life is hanging by a gun
Everyone should have one so they say.
He’d be better off in the front lines of the war
Safer than he is
In the cities here today.

If Times Square was a circus
Than the animals are free
Standing in the neon with the clowns.
The slamming of the taxis
And the hookers looking cool. 
No one’s really safe when the circus is in town.

(Repeat Chorus)

Oh, somewhere the river flows
Somewhere that’s all we know.
Someday it will begin
Oh, someday, hearts will win.

(Repeat Chorus)
