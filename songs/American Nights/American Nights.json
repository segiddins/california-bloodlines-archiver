    "Lyrics": "Lights of the city\nLike jewels in the night\nTheir music is the siren and the scream\nFaces in the city\nWon’t look you in the eye\nThe faces of the wounded and the mean\n\nShadows on the highway\nRavens In the yard\nWho is that coming this way?\nDealers in the school yard\nIn a West Virginia town\nHow did things ever, ever get this way?\n\nChorus:\n\nAmerican nights, Ameri-can days\nAmerican nights, American days\n\nA young mans life is hanging by a gun\nEveryone should have one so they say.\nHe’d be better off in the front lines of the war\nSafer than he is\nIn the cities here today.\n\nIf Times Square was a circus\nThan the animals are free\nStanding in the neon with the clowns.\nThe slamming of the taxis\nAnd the hookers looking cool. \nNo one’s really safe when the circus is in town.\n\n(Repeat Chorus)\n\nOh, somewhere the river flows\nSomewhere that’s all we know.\nSomeday it will begin\nOh, someday, hearts will win.\n\n(Repeat Chorus)\n\n\n",
