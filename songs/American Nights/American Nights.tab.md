Capo 2nd fret

(Em)  (C)  (Em)
Lights of the (C)city
Like jewels in the (Em)night,
Their music is the (C)siren and the (Em)scream.
Faces in the (C)city
Won‚t look you in the (Em)eye,
The faces of the (C)wounded, faces of the (Em)mean.
(C)  (Em)  (C)  (Em)

Shadows on the (C)highway,
Ravens in the (Em)yard.
Who is that (C)coming this (Em)way?
Dealers in the (C)school yard
In a West Virginia (Em)town,
How did things (C)ever, ever get this (D)way?

American (C)nights and Ameri(D)can (Em)days.
Oh, A(C)meri(D)can (C)nights and Ameri(D)can (Em)days.
(C) (Bm)  (C)  (Em)

A young mans (C)life
Is hanging by a (Em)gun.
Everyone should (C)have one, so they (Em)say.
He‚d be better (C)off
In the front lines of the (Em)war,
Safer than he (C)is in the (Em)city here today.
(C) (Bm)  (C)  (Em)

If Times Square was a (C)circus,
Than the animals are (Em)free,
Standing in the (C)neon with the (Em)clowns.
The slamming of the (C)taxis,
And the hookers looking (Em)cool,
No one‚s really (C)safe when the (D)circus is in town.(hold)

American (C)nights, Ameri(D)can (Em)days.
Oh, A(C)meri(D)can (C)nights, Ameri(D)can (Em)days.
American (C)nights, Ameri(D)can (Em)days.
Oh, A(C)meri(D)can (C)nights∑
(Em)  (C)  (Em)  (C)  (Em)  (C)  (Em)  (C)  (Em)

And (C)somewhere the river (Em)flows,
And (C)somewhere, that‚s all we (Em)know,
(C)Someday it will be(Em)gin,
Some(C)day, hearts (G)will (D)win.(hold)

The American (C)nights, Ameri(D)can (Em)days.
A(C)meri(D)can (C)nights, Ameri(D)can (Em)days.
Oh, A(C)meri(D)can (C)nights,(hold) American (Em)days.
American (C)nights(hold) and American (Em)days.
