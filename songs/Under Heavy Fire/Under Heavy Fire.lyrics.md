Oh pretty mama won’t you rock me in the morning
Because I’m under heavy fire from the guns along the way
And oh pretty mama won’t you take it as a warning
Because I’m under heavy fire from the guns along the way

Oh pretty mama won’t you take me to the wire
Because I’m under heavy fire from the guns along the way
And oh pretty mama can’t you see it’s getting higher
Because I’m under heavy fire from the guns along the way

They make a wicked sound
Rock me pretty mama till the wind turns round
I’m spread-eagled on the ground
Rock me pretty mama till it all dies down

Oh pretty mama won’t you rock me in the morning
There are guns along the way
And oh pretty mama won’t you take it as a warning
There are guns along the way
 
They make a wicked sound
Rock me pretty mama till the wind turns round
I’m spread-eagled on the ground
Rock me pretty mama till it all dies down

Oh pretty mama won’t you rock me in the morning
Because I’m under heavy fire from the guns along the way
And oh pretty mama won’t you take it as a warning
Because I’m under heavy fire from the guns along the way

They make a wicked sound
Rock me pretty mama till the wind turns round
I’m spread-eagled on the ground
Rock me pretty mama till it all dies down

Oh pretty mama won’t you rock me in the morning
Because I’m under heavy fire from the guns along the way
And oh pretty mama won’t you take it as a warning
Because I’m under heavy fire from the guns along the way
