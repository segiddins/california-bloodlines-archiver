Hot sun on the highway
Burning barefooted boys walking home from school
Hot sun on the highway
Gotta walk on the green grass just to keep 'em cool

Swift lizard got to run, run
Swift lizard got to run, run
Swift lizard got to run, run, run, run

Hot sun on the highway
Swift lizard, he's sleeping in the noonday sun
Hot boys on the highway
Swift lizard, he knows he's got to run, run, run

Swift lizard got to run, run
Swift lizard got to run, run
Swift lizard got to run, run, run, run

And I feel I've been running
Feel I've been running
Feel I've been running
Too long, too long, too long
Too long, too long, too long

Swift lizard got to run, run
Swift lizard got to run, run
Swift lizard got to run, run, run, run

Swift lizard got to run, run
Swift lizard got to run, run
Swift lizard got to run, run, run, run

Swift lizard won't you look at him run
Swift lizard won't you look at him run
