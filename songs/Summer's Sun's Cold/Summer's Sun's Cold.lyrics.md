Sometimes the summer sun's silver, sometimes the summer sun's gold
Sometimes the summer sun's blazing, sometimes the summer sun's cold
When the summer sun's cold

Sometimes my soul is worth saving, sometimes my soul has been sold
Sometimes the summer sun's silver, sometimes the summer sun's gold
And the summer sun's gold

Sometimes the people keep winning, sometimes the people just fail
Some people, life is like flying, some people, life is a jail
Life is a jail

Sometimes the summer sun's silver, sometimes the summer sun's gold
Sometimes the summer sun's blazing, sometimes the summer sun's cold
And the summer sun's cold
And the summer sun's cold

When the summer sun's cold
When the summer sun's cold
When the summer sun's cold
When the summer sun's cold
When the summer sun's cold
