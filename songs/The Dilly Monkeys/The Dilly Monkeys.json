    "Lyrics": "What kind of people are these?\nWhat kind of people are us?\nThey are people on the highway\nThey are people on the bus\nPeople are crazy\nPeople are mean\nBut, these are the meanest, crazy people I have seen\n\nThey want to shoot the monkeys\nThey want to shoot the little monkeys\nCall all the people and\nWhile you're on the phone say,\n\"You better leave the Dilly monkeys alone\"\n\nWith their little monkey eyes\nLIttle monkey feet\nBut, you never see a monkey walking down the street\nThey got their babies on their back\nRunning for their homes\nYou better leave the little monkeys alone\nYou better leave the little monkeys alone\n\nThey want to shoot the monkeys\nThey want to shoot the little monkeys\nCall all the people and\nWhile you're on the phone say,\n\"You better leave the Dilly monkeys alone\"\n\nYou better leave the Dilly monkeys alone\n(Yeah, leave 'em alone)\nYou better leave the Dilly monkeys alone\n(Why don't you go out and shoot your car or shoot the moon)\nYou better leave the Dilly monkeys alone\n(Haven't you got anything better to do)\nYou better leave the Dilly monkeys alone\n(They don't have any disease)\nYou better leave the Dilly monkeys alone\n(They never hurt anyone)\nYou better leave the Dilly monkeys alone\n(They're just little monkeys, for heaven's sake)\nYou've got to leave the Dilly monkeys alone\nYou've got to leave the little monkeys alone\n\n",
