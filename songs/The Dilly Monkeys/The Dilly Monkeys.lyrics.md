What kind of people are these?
What kind of people are us?
They are people on the highway
They are people on the bus
People are crazy
People are mean
But, these are the meanest, crazy people I have seen

They want to shoot the monkeys
They want to shoot the little monkeys
Call all the people and
While you're on the phone say,
"You better leave the Dilly monkeys alone"

With their little monkey eyes
LIttle monkey feet
But, you never see a monkey walking down the street
They got their babies on their back
Running for their homes
You better leave the little monkeys alone
You better leave the little monkeys alone

They want to shoot the monkeys
They want to shoot the little monkeys
Call all the people and
While you're on the phone say,
"You better leave the Dilly monkeys alone"

You better leave the Dilly monkeys alone
(Yeah, leave 'em alone)
You better leave the Dilly monkeys alone
(Why don't you go out and shoot your car or shoot the moon)
You better leave the Dilly monkeys alone
(Haven't you got anything better to do)
You better leave the Dilly monkeys alone
(They don't have any disease)
You better leave the Dilly monkeys alone
(They never hurt anyone)
You better leave the Dilly monkeys alone
(They're just little monkeys, for heaven's sake)
You've got to leave the Dilly monkeys alone
You've got to leave the little monkeys alone
