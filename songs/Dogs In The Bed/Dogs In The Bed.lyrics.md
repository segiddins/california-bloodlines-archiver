How can I sleep at night with all the things I said?
How can I sleep at night when the evidence is read?
How can I sleep at night when the world is turning red?
Did you hear what I said?
There's dogs in the bed

How can I die at night with things still left undone?
How can I lie at night with a slip of a tongue?
How can I fly at night? I'm a prisoner of the young
Did you hear what I said?
There's dogs in the bed

All night I toss and turn, impossible to sleep
As I watch my life burn, no reason to count sheep
Oh I have miles to go and promises to keep

How can I dream at night when all the dreams come true?
How can I dream at night if I don't dream of you?
How can I scream at night, a rhapsody in blue?
Did you hear what I said?
There's dogs in the bed

All night I toss and turn, impossible to sleep
As I watch my life burn, no reason to count sheep
Oh I have miles to go and promises to keep

How can I sleep at night with all the things I said?
How can I sleep at night when the evidence is read?
How can I sleep at night when the world is turning red?
Did you hear what I said?
There's dogs in the bed

There's dogs in the bed
There's dogs in the bed
There's dogs in the bed
There's dogs in the bed
There's dogs in the bed
