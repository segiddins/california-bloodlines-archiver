    "Lyrics": "How can I sleep at night with all the things I said?\nHow can I sleep at night when the evidence is read?\nHow can I sleep at night when the world is turning red?\nDid you hear what I said?\nThere's dogs in the bed\n\nHow can I die at night with things still left undone?\nHow can I lie at night with a slip of a tongue?\nHow can I fly at night? I'm a prisoner of the young\nDid you hear what I said?\nThere's dogs in the bed\n\nAll night I toss and turn, impossible to sleep\nAs I watch my life burn, no reason to count sheep\nOh I have miles to go and promises to keep\n\nHow can I dream at night when all the dreams come true?\nHow can I dream at night if I don't dream of you?\nHow can I scream at night, a rhapsody in blue?\nDid you hear what I said?\nThere's dogs in the bed\n\nAll night I toss and turn, impossible to sleep\nAs I watch my life burn, no reason to count sheep\nOh I have miles to go and promises to keep\n\nHow can I sleep at night with all the things I said?\nHow can I sleep at night when the evidence is read?\nHow can I sleep at night when the world is turning red?\nDid you hear what I said?\nThere's dogs in the bed\n\nThere's dogs in the bed\nThere's dogs in the bed\nThere's dogs in the bed\nThere's dogs in the bed\nThere's dogs in the bed\n\n",
