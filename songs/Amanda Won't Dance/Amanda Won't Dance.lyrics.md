Well, if Amanda won't dance
I'll sing another song in the morning
If Amanda won't dance
I'll sing another song, I don't care
Till she moves like a queen
Dancing to the rhythm of Sweet Sixteen
And oh, oh, oh, my Amanda

And if Amanda won't laugh
I'll make another pass in the morning
Hey, if Amanda won't laugh
I'll make another pass, I don't care
Till she laughs like a queen
Dancing to the rhythm of Sweet Sixteen
And oh, oh, oh, my Amanda

And if Amanda won't sing
It won't mean a thing in the morning
Oh, if Amanda won't sing
It won't mean a thing, I don't care
Till she sings like a queen
Dancing to the rhythm of Sweet Sixteen
And oh, oh, oh, my Amanda
And oh, oh, oh, my Amanda

And if Amanda won't dance
Amanda won't laugh
Amanda won't sing
And won't take a chance
It's a funny little thing
It's a funny little thing
This romance

And if Amanda won't fly
I won't make her cry in the morning
And if Amanda won't fly, I won't make her cry, I won't care
Till she flies like a queen
Dancing to the rhythm of Sweet Sixteen
And oh, oh, oh, my Amanda
And oh, oh, oh, my Amanda

Till she moves like a queen
Dancing to the rhythm of Sweet Sixteen
And oh, oh, oh, my Amanda
And oh, oh, oh, my Amanda
And oh, oh, oh, my Amanda
