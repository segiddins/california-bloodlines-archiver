    "Lyrics": "I never got to see New Orleans\nOr hear her mournful sound\nHear that singing through the doorways\nThe tapping on the ground\nDancing feet on Bourbon Street\nThe jazz, the blues, the beat\nI never got to see New Orleans\nOr feel the Delta heat\n\nYeah, I never got to see New Orleans\nThe parade on Easy Street\nWhen Mardi Gras was swingin'\nTo the Dixieland retreat\nVoodoo Alley, sweet King Cake\nConfetti rain, for heaven's sakes\nI never got to see New Orleans\nOr feel the Delta heat\n\nAnd her waters may be rising\nBut Orleans is still alive and\nForever she will sing to me\nThe lullabies of used to be\nWill I ever see New Orleans\nAnd hear those melodies?\n\nI never got to see New Orleans\nOr the Gulf of Mexico\nAnd hear the old piano man\nPlay the blues of long ago\nAnd feel the simmer, taste the sweets\nAnd hear the hum on Canal Street\nWill I ever see New Orleans\nAnd feel the Delta heat?\n\nI never got to see New Orleans\nRide the river to the sea\nHear the muse of Louisiana\nSing her heart to me\nFats and Louis and Dixieland\nShe is the river, she is the land\nBut I never got to see New Orleans\nOr hold her in my hand\n\n",
