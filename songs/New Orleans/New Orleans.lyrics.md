I never got to see New Orleans
Or hear her mournful sound
Hear that singing through the doorways
The tapping on the ground
Dancing feet on Bourbon Street
The jazz, the blues, the beat
I never got to see New Orleans
Or feel the Delta heat

Yeah, I never got to see New Orleans
The parade on Easy Street
When Mardi Gras was swingin'
To the Dixieland retreat
Voodoo Alley, sweet King Cake
Confetti rain, for heaven's sakes
I never got to see New Orleans
Or feel the Delta heat

And her waters may be rising
But Orleans is still alive and
Forever she will sing to me
The lullabies of used to be
Will I ever see New Orleans
And hear those melodies?

I never got to see New Orleans
Or the Gulf of Mexico
And hear the old piano man
Play the blues of long ago
And feel the simmer, taste the sweets
And hear the hum on Canal Street
Will I ever see New Orleans
And feel the Delta heat?

I never got to see New Orleans
Ride the river to the sea
Hear the muse of Louisiana
Sing her heart to me
Fats and Louis and Dixieland
She is the river, she is the land
But I never got to see New Orleans
Or hold her in my hand
