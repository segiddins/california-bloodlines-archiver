Who's down now, you're down now
Better get shaking and don't ask how
Like a moonlight rider and a midnight train it's gone
A who now-now
A moonlight rider and a midnight train it's gone

And it's one time, two time, looking in a shoeshine
Looking anywhere for the one time, good time
Like a moonlight rider and a midnight train it's gone
A who now-now
A moonlight rider and a midnight train it's gone

And it's all the same, it's the wind and the rain
It's working all your life for a little bit of fame
Like a moonlight rider and a midnight train it's gone
A who now-now
A moonlight rider and a midnight train it's gone

Who's down now, you're down now
Better get shaking and don't ask how
Like a moonlight rider and a midnight train it's gone
A who now-now
A moonlight rider and a midnight train it's gone
A who now-now
A moonlight rider and a midnight train it's gone
