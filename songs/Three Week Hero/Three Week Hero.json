    "Lyrics": "Oh, I'm a three week hero\nI started off with zero\nAnd I sold a million records on my own\nThree short weeks ago\nI was the lowest of the low\nI knew nothing, now there's nothing I don't know\n\nI am making all the scenes\nfor the teenage magazines\nI had my picture taken with the mayor\nI've got a long - haired lanky girl\nAnd I'm going to save the world\nBut first I think I'd better wash my hair\n\nOh, I'm a three week hero\nI started off with zero\nAnd I sold a million records on my own\nThree short weeks ago\nI was the lowest of the low\nI knew nothing, now there's nothing I don't know\n\nI'm on all the TV shows\nwearing all my far - out clothes\nBut I'm the same old me, I'll never change\nThat guy in the autograph line\nused to be a friend of mine\nAh, this must be a thrill for what's - his - name\n\nOh, I'm a three week hero\nI started off with zero\nAnd I sold a million records on my own\nThree short weeks ago\nI was the lowest of the low\nI knew nothing, now there's nothing I don't know\n\nOh, I'm no longer mobbed\ncos my last two records bombed\nAnd I've squandered all the money that I had\nThe guy who parked my car\nis a big recording star\nAnd all my friends are living at his pad,\n\nNow he's a three week hero\nI started off with zero\nAnd I sold a million records on my own\nThree short weeks ago\nI was the lowest of the low\nI knew nothing, now there's nothing I don't know\n\n",
