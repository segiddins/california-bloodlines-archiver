Oh, I'm a three week hero
I started off with zero
And I sold a million records on my own
Three short weeks ago
I was the lowest of the low
I knew nothing, now there's nothing I don't know

I am making all the scenes
for the teenage magazines
I had my picture taken with the mayor
I've got a long - haired lanky girl
And I'm going to save the world
But first I think I'd better wash my hair

Oh, I'm a three week hero
I started off with zero
And I sold a million records on my own
Three short weeks ago
I was the lowest of the low
I knew nothing, now there's nothing I don't know

I'm on all the TV shows
wearing all my far - out clothes
But I'm the same old me, I'll never change
That guy in the autograph line
used to be a friend of mine
Ah, this must be a thrill for what's - his - name

Oh, I'm a three week hero
I started off with zero
And I sold a million records on my own
Three short weeks ago
I was the lowest of the low
I knew nothing, now there's nothing I don't know

Oh, I'm no longer mobbed
cos my last two records bombed
And I've squandered all the money that I had
The guy who parked my car
is a big recording star
And all my friends are living at his pad,

Now he's a three week hero
I started off with zero
And I sold a million records on my own
Three short weeks ago
I was the lowest of the low
I knew nothing, now there's nothing I don't know
