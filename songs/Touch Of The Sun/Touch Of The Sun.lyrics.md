Rain, rain, rain
Picker it's raining on the borderline
And you're out on the unknown road
Sway back woman by your side
And the pain, pain, pain
Ah, it's time you had a little fun
And a whole lotta rain
And a touch of the sun
You need a touch of the sun

Ride, ride, ride
Hope you live to ride another day
Old lonesome picker
No one cares what dues you pay
You've played one too many beer halls
When there ain't nobody come
Whole lotta rain
And a touch of the sun
You need a touch of the sun

Whole lotta rain
Touch of the sun
You need a touch of the sun
