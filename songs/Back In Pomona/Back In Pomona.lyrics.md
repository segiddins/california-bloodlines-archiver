Blacksmith a-working
In the blacksmith shop and 
His anvil clanking and his coals were hot
Do you remember then
Maybe not my friends
But you know that I can
I was working for my Dad 
And I never was glad
But looking back at all the fun I had at the fair
All the race horse crowd was always there

Back in Pomona, at the county fair
Back in Pomona, at the county fair
Back in Pomona, at the county fair

Sitting on the back of a sulky bike
The silks were red and the silks were white
And the crowd would cheer
Watching the ginny pass round the beer
Lying by the rail
With my ear on the ground
Listen to the rhythm
As the big old pacers come on around

Back in Pomona, at the county fair
Back in Pomona, at the county fair
Back in Pomona, at the county fair

Seems like yesterday
I was there
I was there
I was there

Back in Pomona, at the county fair
Back in Pomona, at the county fair
Back in Pomona, at the county fair
