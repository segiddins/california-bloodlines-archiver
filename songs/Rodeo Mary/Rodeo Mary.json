    "Lyrics": "Rodeo Mary, she wrote me a letter\nShe said your room is all ready, for you\nI saw in the papers they'll be riding the brahmas\nNext Sunday, the fourth, about two....\n \nAnd if you see Rodeo Mary, while you're out on the road\nTell her the rain don't fall on Georgia\nThe sun don't shine on New Mexico roads\nTell her the godchild don't like laughin'...\nBut please don't say...why I'm not coming home...\n \nRodeo Mary, I'm reading your letter\nI'm lonely, and I want to come home\nBut it seems to be, that I caught a disease\nFrom a waitress, who was leading me on\n \nSo if you see Rodeo Mary, while you're out on the road\nTell her that the rain don't fall on Georgia\nThat the sun never shines on those New Mexico Roads\nYou can tell her that the godchild don't like laughin'...\nBut please don't say....why I'm not coming home...\n \nRodeo Mary.......she wrote me a letter......\n\n",
