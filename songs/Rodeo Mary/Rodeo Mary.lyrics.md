Rodeo Mary, she wrote me a letter
She said your room is all ready, for you
I saw in the papers they'll be riding the brahmas
Next Sunday, the fourth, about two....
 
And if you see Rodeo Mary, while you're out on the road
Tell her the rain don't fall on Georgia
The sun don't shine on New Mexico roads
Tell her the godchild don't like laughin'...
But please don't say...why I'm not coming home...
 
Rodeo Mary, I'm reading your letter
I'm lonely, and I want to come home
But it seems to be, that I caught a disease
From a waitress, who was leading me on
 
So if you see Rodeo Mary, while you're out on the road
Tell her that the rain don't fall on Georgia
That the sun never shines on those New Mexico Roads
You can tell her that the godchild don't like laughin'...
But please don't say....why I'm not coming home...
 
Rodeo Mary.......she wrote me a letter......
