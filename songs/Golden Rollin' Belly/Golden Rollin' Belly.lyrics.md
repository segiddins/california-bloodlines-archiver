Out on the road
Without a woman I get lonely
Out on the road
Without a woman I get mad
I don't care what the preachers say
He never had it anyway
Never found it lying on his bed

I mean a golden rolling belly, yeah
Where I can lay my head
I want a golden rolling belly, yeah
Where I can lay my head
I want a golden rolling belly, yeah
Where I can lay my head
I want a golden rolling belly, yeah
Where I can lay my head

Back in the room
I turn on the T.V., I'm not watching
Back in the room
I turn on the radio
And I don't hear
You know what cold showers do
They make you wet
And they turn you blue
Nothing takes the place of what I said

I mean a golden rolling belly, yeah
Where I can lay my head
I want a golden rolling belly, yeah
Where I can lay my head
I want a golden rolling belly, yeah
Where I can lay my head
I want a golden rolling belly, yeah
Where I can lay my head

And if a man said, "Boy, what would you enjoy?
What would take the hair right off your head?"
I'd have to say:

A golden rolling belly, yeah
Where I can lay my head
I want a golden rolling belly, yeah
Where I can lay my head
I want a golden rolling belly, yeah
Where I can lay my head
I want a golden rolling belly, yeah
Where I can lay my head
