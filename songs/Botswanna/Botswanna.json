    "Lyrics": "Oh I live in California\nI can look out at the ocean\nOn the silver blue Pacific\nIt is always there to see\nBut I'm so busy working\nThat I don't have time to see it\nBut it's the knowing that it's there\nThat means lot to me\n\nAnd it makes it hard\nWhen I close my eyes\nWhen I can see the pictures\nTaken at Botswanna\nThe pictures of the children\nWith the flies in their eyes\n\nAnd those with all the money\nThey are having nervous breakdowns\nAnd they're always taking pills\nTo make them feel the otherwise\nWell how could I ever stumble \nOr complain that thing's aren't going right?\nHow could I ever fail\nTo see rainbows in the skies?\n\nAnd it makes it hard\nWhen I close my eyes\nBecause I can see the pictures\nTaken at Botswanna\nThe pictures of the children\nWith the flies in their eyes\n\nOh, faith it is a fire\nAnd it's fanned by the winds of thanks\nI am worried of our numbers\nAnd I'm worried of our ranks\nAs we fire up the Porsches\nFighting to survive\nAnd we look for valet parking\nOut on Rodeo Drive\n\n\nAnd it makes it hard\nI wonder if God cries\nWhen he sees the pictures\nTaken at Botswanna\nThe pictures of the children\nWith the flies in their eyes\n\nAnd I'm not my brother's keeper\nFor I do not have the power\nAs if part of some great game\nThat they play on the other side\nBecause it's all I can do\nTo just keep myself together\nStill I see the faces\nIn the blue pacific tide\n\nAnd it makes it hard\nWhen I close my eyes\nAnd I can see the pictures\nTaken at Botswanna\nThe pictures of the children\nWith the flies in their eyes\n\nIs it not for us to wonder?\nIs it not for us to question?\nIs it not for us to cry out\nThis can not be denied?\nFor we are but a family\nWithout walls but we have waters\nAnd every face you see\nIt is you and it is I\n\nAnd it makes it hard\nWhen you close your eyes\nAnd you can see the pictures\nTaken at Botswanna\n\nThe pictures of the children\n\nYeah, the pictures of the children\nWith the flies in their eyes\n\n",
