Oh I live in California
I can look out at the ocean
On the silver blue Pacific
It is always there to see
But I'm so busy working
That I don't have time to see it
But it's the knowing that it's there
That means lot to me

And it makes it hard
When I close my eyes
When I can see the pictures
Taken at Botswanna
The pictures of the children
With the flies in their eyes

And those with all the money
They are having nervous breakdowns
And they're always taking pills
To make them feel the otherwise
Well how could I ever stumble 
Or complain that thing's aren't going right?
How could I ever fail
To see rainbows in the skies?

And it makes it hard
When I close my eyes
Because I can see the pictures
Taken at Botswanna
The pictures of the children
With the flies in their eyes

Oh, faith it is a fire
And it's fanned by the winds of thanks
I am worried of our numbers
And I'm worried of our ranks
As we fire up the Porsches
Fighting to survive
And we look for valet parking
Out on Rodeo Drive


And it makes it hard
I wonder if God cries
When he sees the pictures
Taken at Botswanna
The pictures of the children
With the flies in their eyes

And I'm not my brother's keeper
For I do not have the power
As if part of some great game
That they play on the other side
Because it's all I can do
To just keep myself together
Still I see the faces
In the blue pacific tide

And it makes it hard
When I close my eyes
And I can see the pictures
Taken at Botswanna
The pictures of the children
With the flies in their eyes

Is it not for us to wonder?
Is it not for us to question?
Is it not for us to cry out
This can not be denied?
For we are but a family
Without walls but we have waters
And every face you see
It is you and it is I

And it makes it hard
When you close your eyes
And you can see the pictures
Taken at Botswanna

The pictures of the children

Yeah, the pictures of the children
With the flies in their eyes
