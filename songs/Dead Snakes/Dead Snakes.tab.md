(Em)
A little girl stops in the middle of the road,
Frozen in fear, (Bm)frozen in (Em)fear,
For a snake is stretched ´cross the middle of the road,
Still and clear, (Bm)still and (Em)clear.
She (G)can't go on and she (Am7)won't turn (D)back,
(G)She feels a (Em)sweat come (Am7)running down her (D)back,
She'd (G)still be (Em)there if (Am7)no one (D)said,
Said, (C)(hold)"Hey little girl, the (Bm)(hold)snake is dead." (Em)

My father' s face is as clear today
As before the time that he (Bm)went a(Em)way.
Said, "You can't win, your ass is lead."
I'm a prisoner of the (Bm)words he (Em)said.
I (G)can't go on and I (Am7)won't turn (D)back,
(G)I hear the (Em)train come (Am7)yelling down the (D)track.
I'd (G)still be (Em)there if (Am7)no one (D)said,
Said, (C)(hold)"Hey little boy, the (Bm)(hold)snake is dead."
(Em)(Em)(Em)(Em*)(Em)(Em)(Em)(Em*)(Em)(Em)(Em)(Em*)
(Em)(Em)(Em)(Em*)(Em)(Em)(Em)(Em*)(Em)(Em)(Em)(Em*)

Beware (Em*)little fat boys,(Em*)
They turn in(Em*)to angry hunters. (Em*)(Em)(Em)(Em)(Em*)
Beware (Em*)little fat boys, (Em*)
They know the (Em*)spell they're under.(Em*)
(G)They know hurt, (D)they know pain,
(G)They know (Em)life standing (Am7)out there in the (D)rain,
And they'd (G)still be (Em)there if (Am7)no one (D)said,
Said, (C)(hold)"Hey little boy, the (Bm)(hold)snake is dead." (Em)

Snake said to Eve, said, "Come here, baby,
Bite my apple, it'll (Bm)turn you into a (Em)lady."
Eve took a bite and things got rough,
You can always get some, but you can (Bm)never get e(Em)nough.
You´ll (G)still be (Em)there 'till (Am7)someone (D)says,
Says, (C)(hold)"Hey, everybody, the (Bm)(hold)snake is dead." (Em)
The snake is dead.
