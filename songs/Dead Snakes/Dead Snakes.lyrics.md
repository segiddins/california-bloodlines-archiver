A little girl stops in the middle of the road
Frozen in fear, frozen in fear
For a snake is stretched across the middle of the road
Still and clear, still and clear
She can't go on and she won't turn back
She feels a sweat come running down her back
She'd still be there if no one said
Said "Hey little girl, the snake is dead".

My father' s face is as clear today
Before the time that he went away
Said "You can't win, your ass is lead"
I'm a prisoner of the words he said
I can't go on and I won't turn back
I hear the train come yelling down the track
I'd still be there if no one said
Said "Hey little boy, the snake is dead"

Beware little fat boys
They turn into angry hunters
Beware little fat boys
They know the spell they're under
They know hurt, they know pain
They know life standing out there in the rain
And they'd still be there if no one said
Said "Hey little boy, the snake is dead"

Snake said to Eve, said "Come here baby
Bite my apple, I'll turn you into a lady"
Eve took a bite and things got rough
You can always get some, but you can never get enough
We'd still be there 'till someone says
Says "Hey everybody, the snake is dead"

The snake is dead
