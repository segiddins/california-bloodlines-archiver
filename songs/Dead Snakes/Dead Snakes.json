    "Lyrics": "A little girl stops in the middle of the road\nFrozen in fear, frozen in fear\nFor a snake is stretched across the middle of the road\nStill and clear, still and clear\nShe can't go on and she won't turn back\nShe feels a sweat come running down her back\nShe'd still be there if no one said\nSaid \"Hey little girl, the snake is dead\".\n\nMy father' s face is as clear today\nBefore the time that he went away\nSaid \"You can't win, your ass is lead\"\nI'm a prisoner of the words he said\nI can't go on and I won't turn back\nI hear the train come yelling down the track\nI'd still be there if no one said\nSaid \"Hey little boy, the snake is dead\"\n\nBeware little fat boys\nThey turn into angry hunters\nBeware little fat boys\nThey know the spell they're under\nThey know hurt, they know pain\nThey know life standing out there in the rain\nAnd they'd still be there if no one said\nSaid \"Hey little boy, the snake is dead\"\n\nSnake said to Eve, said \"Come here baby\nBite my apple, I'll turn you into a lady\"\nEve took a bite and things got rough\nYou can always get some, but you can never get enough\nWe'd still be there 'till someone says\nSays \"Hey everybody, the snake is dead\"\n\nThe snake is dead\n\n",
