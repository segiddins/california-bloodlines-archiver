He was born again in the Georgia wind
The eldest son of Miss Lillian
He was born to win with his Georgia grin
You just sell 'em the Lord and you promise the wind
Sell 'em the Lord and you promise the wind

And he said "I'm the one" in the Georgia sun
"Oh, Georgia dirt farmers, there's work to be done"
He said "Rosalynn, keep on smiling
You just sell 'em the Lord and you promise the wind"
Sell 'em the Lord and you promise the wind
Sell 'em the Lord and you promise the wind
Sell 'em the Lord and you promise the wind

And across the fields of Plains 
Good old boys walking home in the rain
And there's redneck Billy and beer
Don't look like something's going on here
But there's a man there out to win
Banking on his Georgia grin
Oh, it's so easy to sucker us in
Sell us the Lord and you promise the wind
Sell us the Lord and you promise the wind

He was born again in the Georgia wind
The eldest son of Miss Lillian
He was born to win with his Georgia grin
You just sell us the Lord and you promise the wind
Sell us the Lord and you promise the wind
Sell us the Lord and you promise the wind
Sell us the Lord and you promise the wind
