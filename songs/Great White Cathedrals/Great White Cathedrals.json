    "Lyrics": "Was it you all along, good Jesus \nWere you all along the right way?\nOh, you told me you were, but the writing was blurred\nThe people who told me, they twisted your words\nSaying burn, child, burn, when in your name will they learn?\nThat you can't buy a soul with his silver and gold\nAnd a sway-backed old jackass was all that you rode\nAs the bells still peal in the great white cathedrals \nOf people forgetting to feel\n\nWas it you all along green meadow\nWere you all along my true home?\nYour grass sure was cool, with your high mountain pools\nBut out on the highway I became like the fools\nSaying burn, child, burn, when in the world will I learn?\nThat you must stay alive, in the cities you die\nAnd old mother nature just fights to survive\nAs the bells still peal in the great white cathedrals\nOf people forgetting to feel\n\n",
