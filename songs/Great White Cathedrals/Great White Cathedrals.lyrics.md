Was it you all along, good Jesus 
Were you all along the right way?
Oh, you told me you were, but the writing was blurred
The people who told me, they twisted your words
Saying burn, child, burn, when in your name will they learn?
That you can't buy a soul with his silver and gold
And a sway-backed old jackass was all that you rode
As the bells still peal in the great white cathedrals 
Of people forgetting to feel

Was it you all along green meadow
Were you all along my true home?
Your grass sure was cool, with your high mountain pools
But out on the highway I became like the fools
Saying burn, child, burn, when in the world will I learn?
That you must stay alive, in the cities you die
And old mother nature just fights to survive
As the bells still peal in the great white cathedrals
Of people forgetting to feel
