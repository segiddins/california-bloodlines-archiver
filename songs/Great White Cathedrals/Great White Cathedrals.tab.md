Was it (G)you all a(G/F#)long, good (Em)Jesus,(high notes g-b-a-g) 
Were (C)you all a(Am)long the right (G/D)way? (G7/F) 
Oh, you (C)told me you (Am7short)were, 
But the (G)writing was (Em)blurred. 
The (E4/C#)people who told me, they (D)twisted your (D7)words, 
Saying (Em)burn, (C/E)child, (D)burn,(bass run, middle strings D-F#-G-A-G-F#) 
(C/E)When in your (D)name will they (G)learn (G7/F) 
That you (C/E)can't buy a (Am)soul 
With his (Bm)silver and (G)gold? 
And a (E4/C#)sway-backed old jackass was (D)all that you rode, 
As the (Em)bells (C/E)still (D)peal(bass run, middle strings D-F#-G-A-G-F#) 
In the (C/E)great white ca(C/D, hammer on E)thedrals

Was it (G)you all a(G/F#)long, green (Em)meadow, (add A-note on G-string, bend) 
Were (C)you all a(Am)long my true (G/D)home? (G7/F) 
Your (C)grass sure was (Am7short)cool, 
With your (G)high mountain (Em)pools 
But (E4/C#)out on the highway, I be(D)came like the (D7)fools 
Saying (Em)burn, (C/E)child, (D)burn,(bass run, middle strings D-F#-G-A-G-F#-E) 
(C/E)When in the (D)world will I (G)learn (G7/F)
That you (C/E)must stay a(Am)live? 
In the (Bm)cities you (G)die. 
And (E4/C#)old mother nature just (D)fights to survive, 
As the (Em)bells (C/E)still (D)peal(bass run, middle strings D-F#-G-A-G-F#-E)
