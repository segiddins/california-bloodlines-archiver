Out there on the street 
You can hear them mumble
Stumble on their feet
They are all the desperate men

Out there on the road
You see them on the highway
Everywhere you go
They are all the desperate men

All the desperate men 
Singing, "Will I ever
Will I ever love again?"
All the desperate men 

Right there in your bed
Tossing and turning
On the pillow by your head
All the desperate men 

Right there in your arms
You can hear him crying
Sounding the alarm
All the desperate men 

All the desperate men 
Singing, "Will I ever
Will I ever love again?"
All the desperate men 

All the desperate men 
All the desperate men 
All the desperate men 
All the desperate men
