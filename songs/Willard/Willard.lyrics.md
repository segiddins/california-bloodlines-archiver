Willard, he's a loner
Living by the railway
Living by the tracks beside his home
Willard, he's a loner
If you're going his way
Say hello, he ain't got no one to call his own

Soldiers of glass
Standing by the trash
Willard's coloured bottles in a line
Soldiers of glass
It's funny you should ask
But they're the only friends he has to pass the time
But they're the only friends he has to pass the time

And his Mamma knows that he was once a child
Mamma, she was the first one to hear his cry
And my Mamma knows that I was once a child
Could it be we're all just Willard in disguise?
Could it be we're all just Willard in disguise?

I hear they're tearing down
All the buildings in his town
The house where Willard Jefferson has stayed
But they can't tear him down
No he will always be around
'Cause he's as hard as all that old black, river clay

Yet his Mamma knows that he was once a child
Mamma, she was the first one to hear his cry
And my Mamma knows that I was once a child
Could it be we're all just Willard in disguise?
Could it be we're all just Willard in disguise?

Willard, he's a loner
Living by the railway
Living by the tracks beside his home
Willard, he's a loner
If you're going his way
Say hello, he ain't got no one to call his own
