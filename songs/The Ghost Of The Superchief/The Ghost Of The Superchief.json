    "Lyrics": "Red lanterns in a foggy night\nLonesome whistles down shining, wounded rails\nAs the ghost of the Superchief silently runs through the Indiana farmland\nDeep in the heart of a country trying desperately to remember itself.\n\nTo remember Norman Rockwell, and mealtime prayers\nMom and Dad and second floor stairs\nGuests for dinner, don't be late\nIron streetlights, garden gates\nThe Mission Inn and the Riverside days\nNancy Mulkee, sidewalk play\nHonking horns on VJ day\nTexaco fire in a bright red sky\nHop-Along Cassidy\nNeckerchief slides\nJimmy Stewart and Doris Day\nBarry Fitzgerald going my way \nNational Velvet, Kim Novak's eyes\nThe \"Bells of St. Mary's\" \nThe Best Years of our Lives\n\nCounty fairs and carnival rides\nTilt a wheel and shoot the moon\nElectric horserace, pale balloons,\nSummer days that never end\nBlue Schwinn Bikes, the best of friends\nPasadena and Chappman Woods\nTouch football in the neighbourhood\nMerit badges \nBright white futures and cool machines\nMovie stars and boyhood dreams\nAs the ghost of the Superchief silently runs through the Indiana farmland\nDeep in the heart of a country trying desperately to remember itself.\n\nIt was \"Inner Sanctum\" and \"Abby \u0026 Slats\"\n\"The FBI\", \"In Peace and War\"\n\"I Love a Mystery,\" Di Maggio's bat\nEdgar Bergen and Mortimer Snerd\nCorlius Archer and spoken words\nThat had more pictures than NBC\nGrand Central Station, Fibber McGee\nAnd Molly and the closet door\nBlondie and Dagwood, lying on the floor\nWith my eyes closed tight and worlds away\nAs the radio blended night from day\n\nThere was Woodrow Wilson Jr. High\nRosemead, Colorado, Thorndale signs\nCorona lunch breaks, Second World War\nFresh mowed laws and hobby stores\nDistant whistle of distant trains\nFive o'clock shadows and the summer rain\nAs the Superchief runs silently through the Indiana farmland\nDeep in the heart of a country trying desperately to remember itself\n\n",
