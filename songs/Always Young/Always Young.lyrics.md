I'm a teenage kid from my high school days you know
I got grown up clothes and grown up ways and so
A kid has dreams in a grown up haze
'Cause I can't live in yesterday
I can't live, oooh
In yesterday
I just can't live in yesterday
In yesterday
I can't live in yesterday

When I hear "Da Do Run Run" you know
"Don't Be Cruel" and "Born To Run" and so
I crank it up and pop a can
And then I know just who I am
I know, oooh
Just who I am
Simply who I am
Just who I am
Simply who I am

There is a bird I keep inside you know
And I keep her free so she can fly and so
The song she sings is "You have won 
If in your heart you're always young"
In your heart, oooh
You're always young
If you sing you're always young
You're always young
If you sing you're always young

The Trio died in 61 you know
They tapped me; they said come here son and so
Double parked, let the motor run
We get the money, you get the fun
Oooh, oooh
I got the fun
Singing in the sun
I got the fun
Singing in the sun

I'm a teenage kid from my high school days you know
I got grown up clothes and grown up ways and so
And every friend that I have known
They all say you're not alone
They say, oooh
You're not alone
They say you're not alone
You're not alone
They say you're not alone

There is a bird I keep inside you know
And I keep her free so she can fly and so
The song she sings is "You have won 
If in your heart you're always young"
In your heart, oooh
You're always young
If you sing you're always young
You're always young
If you sing you're always young
