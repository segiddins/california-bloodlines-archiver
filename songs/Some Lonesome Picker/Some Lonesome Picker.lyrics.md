I often get the feeling that I'm talking to the wind
And no-one hears, no-one listens in
Then I start singing songs 
And the music makes the whole world feel like home
Sing a song and you're not alone

Lilly McLean, you are standing in the rain 
And you are cold, you are hungry and afraid
You are waiting for a sunrise
A sunrise makes you feel so very small
Darling Lilly, aren't we all?

Oh I'm believing, believing
Believing, that even when I'm gone
Maybe some lonesome picker will
Find some healing in this song

Julie get the gun, Julie throw it in the river 
Let it roll far on out to sea
Let it carry the confusion
The hatred and the worry here in me
River rolling out to sea

Oh I'm believing, believing
Believing, that even when I'm gone
Maybe some lonesome picker will
Find some healing in this song

Maybe some lonesome picker will
Find some healing in this song
