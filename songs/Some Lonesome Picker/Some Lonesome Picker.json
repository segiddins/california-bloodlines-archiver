    "Lyrics": "I often get the feeling that I'm talking to the wind\nAnd no-one hears, no-one listens in\nThen I start singing songs \nAnd the music makes the whole world feel like home\nSing a song and you're not alone\n\nLilly McLean, you are standing in the rain \nAnd you are cold, you are hungry and afraid\nYou are waiting for a sunrise\nA sunrise makes you feel so very small\nDarling Lilly, aren't we all?\n\nOh I'm believing, believing\nBelieving, that even when I'm gone\nMaybe some lonesome picker will\nFind some healing in this song\n\nJulie get the gun, Julie throw it in the river \nLet it roll far on out to sea\nLet it carry the confusion\nThe hatred and the worry here in me\nRiver rolling out to sea\n\nOh I'm believing, believing\nBelieving, that even when I'm gone\nMaybe some lonesome picker will\nFind some healing in this song\n\nMaybe some lonesome picker will\nFind some healing in this song\n\n",
