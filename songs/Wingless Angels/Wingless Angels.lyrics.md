Wingless angels
Pull the boats of Amsterdam
Wingless angels
Grease the cars of Birmingham
Wingless angels
Work the fields of Ohio
Wingless angels
Walk the streets of Chicago

And it sure is a long way home
It sure is a long way home
It sure is a long way home
It sure is a long way home

Wingless angels
Stand amazed at eagles flight
Wingless angels
Cry themselves to sleep at night

And it sure is a long way home
It sure is a long way home
It sure is a long way home
It sure is a long way home

Wingless angels
Pull the boats of Amsterdam
Wingless angels
Grease the cars in Birmingham

And it sure is a long way home
It sure is a long way home
It sure is a long way home
It sure is a long way home
