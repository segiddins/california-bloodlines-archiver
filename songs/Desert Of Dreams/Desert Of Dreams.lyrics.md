Fins of sixty Cadillacs
Lined up in a row
In a parking lot in Vegas
Waiting to be towed
The repo man is laughing yeah
As the losers come and go

You ask me if I miss someone
I would tell you true
The answer is I miss someone
I just can't remember who
Got my neon nightlight on
Thinking more of you

Apart at the seams, in this desert of dreams
I'm apart at the seams, in a desert of dreams

Steel Casino, four a.m.
Moriachies lonely men
Can't believe I'm here again
Flamingo Hotel
And I'm drawn into an inside straight
I can't seem to concentrate
Taking time to meditate
'Cause I'm not doing well

I'm apart at the seams, in this desert of dreams
I'm apart at the seams, in this desert of dreams
I'm apart at the seams, in this desert of dreams

Fins of sixty Cadillacs
Lined up in a row
In a parking lot in Vegas
Waiting to be towed
No-one here is laughing yeah
As the greyhounds come and go

I'm apart at the seams, in a desert of dreams
I'm apart at the seams, in a desert of dreams
I'm apart at the seams, in a desert of dreams
