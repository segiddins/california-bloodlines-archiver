    "Lyrics": "Fins of sixty Cadillacs\nLined up in a row\nIn a parking lot in Vegas\nWaiting to be towed\nThe repo man is laughing yeah\nAs the losers come and go\n\nYou ask me if I miss someone\nI would tell you true\nThe answer is I miss someone\nI just can't remember who\nGot my neon nightlight on\nThinking more of you\n\nApart at the seams, in this desert of dreams\nI'm apart at the seams, in a desert of dreams\n\nSteel Casino, four a.m.\nMoriachies lonely men\nCan't believe I'm here again\nFlamingo Hotel\nAnd I'm drawn into an inside straight\nI can't seem to concentrate\nTaking time to meditate\n'Cause I'm not doing well\n\nI'm apart at the seams, in this desert of dreams\nI'm apart at the seams, in this desert of dreams\nI'm apart at the seams, in this desert of dreams\n\nFins of sixty Cadillacs\nLined up in a row\nIn a parking lot in Vegas\nWaiting to be towed\nNo-one here is laughing yeah\nAs the greyhounds come and go\n\nI'm apart at the seams, in a desert of dreams\nI'm apart at the seams, in a desert of dreams\nI'm apart at the seams, in a desert of dreams\n\n",
