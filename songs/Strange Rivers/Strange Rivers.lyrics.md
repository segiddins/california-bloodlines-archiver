There are voices in the mirror
And there are faces at the door
And they open on the rivers
We've never seen before
And are there choices for the Sparrow
Or does he only fly
High above the rivers
Pulling you and I?

There are strange rivers
Rivers that you can not see
And there are strange rivers
Who know our destiny
And there are strange rivers
And we're sailors
You and me

And he could have been a builder
He could have been the one
To turn his dreams to steel
Cathedrals in the sun
And he could have been a builder
But then he bought the gun
There are forces in that river
That keep him on the run

There are strange rivers
Rivers that you can not see
And there are strange rivers
Who know our destiny
And there are strange rivers
And we're sailors
You and me

Did you ever turn the corner
And you wondered why you did
'Cause you haven't been that way, now
Since you were just a kid
And nothing really happened
But then you've got to say
That you wonder what would've happened
Had you gone the other way
There are strange rivers
Rivers that you can not see
And there are strange rivers
Who know our destiny
And there are strange rivers
And we're sailors
You and me

For there are strange rivers
There are strange rivers
And there are strange rivers
There are strange rivers
Oh, there are strange rivers
There are strange rivers

Feel the river
See the river
Be the river
