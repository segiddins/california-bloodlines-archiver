Far beyond your mirror
Far beyond your dreams
Far beyond your moon signs
Far beyond your schemes
Far beyond the brother-hood
Far beyond James Dean
He was not James Dean
Is what I really mean

Where I am not the hunter 
Still I am the hunter’s son 
And we really all are women yes
When all is said and done
Said and done

Far beyond what I believe
Or what my father said
Far beyond genetic codes
That run ‘till we are dead
Far beyond the Catholics
Far beyond the Jews
I am safe here with the mother
I am safe here so are you 

Where I am not the hunter 
Still I am the hunter’s son 
And we really all are women yes 
When all is said and done
We really all are women
When all is said and done
Said and done

The peeling of the onion
As the pieces start to fall
You begin to see the faces
And the shadows on the wall
Tearing down the missiles
The pictures start to come
The image of a rosary
On the barrel of a gun


Waiting for the big one
I am living on the coast
Why do we deny
The things we fear the most
I am safe here with the mother
I am safe here in her arms
Still I hear the voices
Sounding the alarm

Where I am not the hunter 
Still I am the hunter’s son 
And we really all are women yes
When all is said and done
We really all are women yes
When all is said and done
Said and done

And we really all are women yes
When all is said and done
We really all are women yes
When all is said and done
Said and done
