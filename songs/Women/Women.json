    "Lyrics": "Far beyond your mirror\nFar beyond your dreams\nFar beyond your moon signs\nFar beyond your schemes\nFar beyond the brother-hood\nFar beyond James Dean\nHe was not James Dean\nIs what I really mean\n\nWhere I am not the hunter \nStill I am the hunter’s son \nAnd we really all are women yes\nWhen all is said and done\nSaid and done\n\nFar beyond what I believe\nOr what my father said\nFar beyond genetic codes\nThat run ‘till we are dead\nFar beyond the Catholics\nFar beyond the Jews\nI am safe here with the mother\nI am safe here so are you \n\nWhere I am not the hunter \nStill I am the hunter’s son \nAnd we really all are women yes \nWhen all is said and done\nWe really all are women\nWhen all is said and done\nSaid and done\n\nThe peeling of the onion\nAs the pieces start to fall\nYou begin to see the faces\nAnd the shadows on the wall\nTearing down the missiles\nThe pictures start to come\nThe image of a rosary\nOn the barrel of a gun\n\n\nWaiting for the big one\nI am living on the coast\nWhy do we deny\nThe things we fear the most\nI am safe here with the mother\nI am safe here in her arms\nStill I hear the voices\nSounding the alarm\n\nWhere I am not the hunter \nStill I am the hunter’s son \nAnd we really all are women yes\nWhen all is said and done\nWe really all are women yes\nWhen all is said and done\nSaid and done\n\nAnd we really all are women yes\nWhen all is said and done\nWe really all are women yes\nWhen all is said and done\nSaid and done\n\n",
