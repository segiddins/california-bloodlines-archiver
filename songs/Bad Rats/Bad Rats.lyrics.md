Good rats all have wheels
Good rats all have names
Good rats all can feel
Good rats are the same
Good rats all have friends
Good rats all can eat
Good rats all get papers
To protect their little feet.

It’s a song about the good rats

Bad rats have no names
Bad rats have disease
Bad rats are the same
Bad rats all must leave
Bad rats have no friends
Bad rats die alone
Let’s all kill the bad rats
And pass around the stone

It’s a song about the bad rats
Yeah, song about the bad rats
Yeah, song about the bad rats

There ain’t no way you know 
Of telling who’s a bad rat. 
There ain’t no way you know
Of telling who’s a bad rat. 
There ain’t no way that I know
Of telling who’s a bad rat. 

Look at all them Asian people
I’m glad they aren’t like me.
Look at all them inner city people
Glad they’re not like me
Look at all those homeless people
Glad they’re not like me
Song about the bad rats
