I was hopin' that you'ld come to me
It's plain and I can see
That you are crying
Yes, you are crying
Yeah I have often lied
To cover up my pride
And I have hurt you
Yes I have hurt you

Let us be together
As we face this stormy weather
Gaze on other heavens
Don't you cry
Don't you cry

I have other friends
I think that they're the end
But I just love you
I just love you
It goes on and on
Longer than a song
I will need you
I will need you

Let us be together
As we face this stormy weather
Gaze on other heavens
Don't you cry
Don't you cry

La da da
Da da da
Da da da da da
Oooowee yeah

Let us be together
As we face this stormy weather
Gaze on other heavens
Don't you cry
Don't you cry

I was hopin' that you'ld come to me
It's plain and I can see
That you are crying
Yes, you are crying
I have often lied
To cover up my pride
And I have hurt you
Yes I have hurt you

Let us be together
As we face this stormy weather
Gaze on other heavens
Don't you cry
Don't you cry
Oh, don't you cry
Oh, don't you cry
Oh, don't you cry
