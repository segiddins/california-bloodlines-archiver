If children never were hurt
No reason for babies to cry
Nobody ever was hungry
No one you loved ever died
Nobody ever was heartless
Nobody ever was cruel
If everyone got all their wishes
And only the good would rule

These are the dreams of the Starman
Even if he never is heard
These are the dreams of the Starman
Forever the keeper of words

If religions never were righteous
Believing that they are the one
If never there was ever a reason
Ever to fire a gun

These are the dreams of the Starman
Even if he never is heard
These are the dreams of the Starman
Forever the keeper of words

If we would just live all our own lives
Leave other people alone
And if those who just love one another
Would not be the targets of stones

These are the dreams of the Starman
Even if he never is heard
These are the dreams of the Starman
Forever the keeper of words

These are the dreams of the Starman
Even if he never is heard
These are the dreams of the Starman
