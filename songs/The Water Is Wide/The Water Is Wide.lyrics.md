The water is wide I can not see
Neither have I wings to fly
But build me a boat that can carry two
And both shall row, my love and I

I lean my back against some young oak
Thinking it was a trusty tree
But first it bended and then it broke
Just like my love has forsaken me

Love is gentle and love is kind
Just like the tree when first itâ€™s new
But love grows old and waxes cold
And fades away like the morning dew

The water is wide I can not see
Neither have I wings to fly
But build me a boat that can carry two
And both shall row, my love and I
