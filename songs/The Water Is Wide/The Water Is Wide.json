    "Lyrics": "The water is wide I can not see\nNeither have I wings to fly\nBut build me a boat that can carry two\nAnd both shall row, my love and I\n\nI lean my back against some young oak\nThinking it was a trusty tree\nBut first it bended and then it broke\nJust like my love has forsaken me\n\nLove is gentle and love is kind\nJust like the tree when first it’s new\nBut love grows old and waxes cold\nAnd fades away like the morning dew\n\nThe water is wide I can not see\nNeither have I wings to fly\nBut build me a boat that can carry two\nAnd both shall row, my love and I\n\n",
