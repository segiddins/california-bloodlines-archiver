She believes the witches fly crazy 'cross the moon
She believes an angel hides in the corner of her room
She believes the ships come home singing from the sea
She believes in losers, oh, she believes in me

She believes a pot of gold marks the rainbow's end
She believes a light will show the lonesome, homeward friend
She believes the weary soul one day will be free
She believes in losers, oh, she believes in me

Blow lightly wind so she can ride
Blow lightly wind and I will see her by and by
Away with the fools who tell her I am make believe
She believes in losers, oh, she believes in me

She believes in losers, oh
She believes in me
She believes in me
She believes in me
