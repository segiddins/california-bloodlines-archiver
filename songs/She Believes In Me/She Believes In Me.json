    "Lyrics": "She believes the witches fly crazy 'cross the moon\nShe believes an angel hides in the corner of her room\nShe believes the ships come home singing from the sea\nShe believes in losers, oh, she believes in me\n\nShe believes a pot of gold marks the rainbow's end\nShe believes a light will show the lonesome, homeward friend\nShe believes the weary soul one day will be free\nShe believes in losers, oh, she believes in me\n\nBlow lightly wind so she can ride\nBlow lightly wind and I will see her by and by\nAway with the fools who tell her I am make believe\nShe believes in losers, oh, she believes in me\n\nShe believes in losers, oh\nShe believes in me\nShe believes in me\nShe believes in me\n\n",
