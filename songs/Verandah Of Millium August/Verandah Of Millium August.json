    "Lyrics": "The yellow window's hanging on the bed across the wall\nWell, always in the morning the yellowest of all\nAnd the faces of the people in the window look so small\nAnd the faces in the morning were the peoplest of all\nStanding on the verandah of Millium August\n\nI love to watch the spider in the horn of the Victrola\nAnd the window I have colored with a burnt umber crayola\nThe chairs are musty horses with something else's odor\nAnd somewhere in the cushion is a secret ring decoder\nStanding on the verandah of Millium August\n\nWhile I am turning cartwheels, the kaleidoscope is singing\nAnd, somewhere in the distance, someone else's phone is ringing\nThere are rugs upon the ceiling, there are lamps upon the floor\nAnd Rennisance wallpaper they put across the door\nThe house has been torn down and everyone has gone\nAnd I am held a prisoner on a cemetary lawn\nStanding on the verandah of Millium August\n\n",
