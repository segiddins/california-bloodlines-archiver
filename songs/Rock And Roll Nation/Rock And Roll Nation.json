    "Lyrics": "His mother was the Mississippi delta yeah\nHis father was the alligator blues\nHe was born in a studio in Memphis\nHis mother was the blue suede shoes\nAnd he's ours all the way yeah\nHe was born in the USA\n\nAnd he came from a guitar playing country\nHe was raised on Cadillacs and dreams\nWhen he started playing \"Whole Lotta Shaking\" \nComing apart at the seams\nAnd he's ours all the way yeah\nHe was born in the USA\n\nLiving in a rock and roll nation\nLiving in our own creation\nLiving is our coronation\nLiving in a rock and roll nation\n\nEvery kid in every household in the country\nHad a 45 lying in his room\nSinging Jim Dandy to the rescue\nCould raise a dead man from his tomb\nAnd he's ours all the way yeah\nHe was born in the USA\n\nLiving in a rock and roll nation\nRocking is our destination\nRocking is our fortification\nLiving in a rock and roll nation\n\nEvery kid who was born in the 50's \nWhen Elvis was the king of the scene\nJerry  Lee playing the piano\nChuck Berry singing Maybellene\n\nLiving in a rock and roll nation\nRocking is a realization\nDon't need no justification\nLiving in a rock and roll nation\n\n\nLiving in a rock and roll nation\nLiving in our generation\nWe got an infatuation\nLiving in a rock and roll\nLiving in a rock and roll \nLiving in a rock and roll nation\n\nLiving in a rock and roll nation\nLiving in a rock and roll nation\nLiving in a rock and roll nation\n\n",
