His mother was the Mississippi delta yeah
His father was the alligator blues
He was born in a studio in Memphis
His mother was the blue suede shoes
And he's ours all the way yeah
He was born in the USA

And he came from a guitar playing country
He was raised on Cadillacs and dreams
When he started playing "Whole Lotta Shaking" 
Coming apart at the seams
And he's ours all the way yeah
He was born in the USA

Living in a rock and roll nation
Living in our own creation
Living is our coronation
Living in a rock and roll nation

Every kid in every household in the country
Had a 45 lying in his room
Singing Jim Dandy to the rescue
Could raise a dead man from his tomb
And he's ours all the way yeah
He was born in the USA

Living in a rock and roll nation
Rocking is our destination
Rocking is our fortification
Living in a rock and roll nation

Every kid who was born in the 50's 
When Elvis was the king of the scene
Jerry  Lee playing the piano
Chuck Berry singing Maybellene

Living in a rock and roll nation
Rocking is a realization
Don't need no justification
Living in a rock and roll nation


Living in a rock and roll nation
Living in our generation
We got an infatuation
Living in a rock and roll
Living in a rock and roll 
Living in a rock and roll nation

Living in a rock and roll nation
Living in a rock and roll nation
Living in a rock and roll nation
