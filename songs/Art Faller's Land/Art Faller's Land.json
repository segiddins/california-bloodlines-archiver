    "Lyrics": "Yeah, I know you heard Gonzalez is an excellent man,\nYou want him when you travel 'cause he'll do what he can,\nBut I gotta warn you, he won't understand,\nSo never say a word \nAbout Art Faller's land.\n\nGonzalez, he's a guy with a natural calm,\nHe makes a living as a lawyer and he mows his own lawn.\nHe checks outs the gigs and he drives to the shows,\nHe'll sell what you got \nWhen they're  ready to close.\nOh, I got a guitar, so he gives me a hand,\nI never say a word about  Art Faller´s land.\n\nFaller picked me up for the Rhode Island show\nStayed at his place, he´s as nice as they go.\nSaid, \"You travel light and you don´t have a band,\nLet me take you out and show you \nSome of  Art Faller´s land.\"\n\nI asked about Gonzalez, says he knows him real good,\nThey used to tear around in the old neighbour(G)hood.\nSaid, he got a little funny and he called himself Dan,\nHe never took a drive \nOut to  Art Faller´s land,\nHe never took a drive out to  Art Faller´s land.\n\nOn the last tour, maybe nine months or so,\nWe stopped to get gas and a Yoo-Hoo to go\nI asked Gonzalez, \"Who calls you Dan?\"\nHe snapped like a dog \nGoin´ to  take off your hand.\nHe said, \"How should I know? Maybe some little man,\nKeeps monkeys wearing speedos on Art Faller´s land.\n \nHe gets funny, so you don´t call him Dan,\nAnd never say a word about  Art Faller´s land,\nNo, never say a word about  Art Faller´s land,\nYou never say a word, never say a word,\nNever say a word about Art Faller´s land.\n\n",
