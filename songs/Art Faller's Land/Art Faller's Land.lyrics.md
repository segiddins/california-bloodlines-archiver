Yeah, I know you heard Gonzalez is an excellent man,
You want him when you travel 'cause he'll do what he can,
But I gotta warn you, he won't understand,
So never say a word 
About Art Faller's land.

Gonzalez, he's a guy with a natural calm,
He makes a living as a lawyer and he mows his own lawn.
He checks outs the gigs and he drives to the shows,
He'll sell what you got 
When they're  ready to close.
Oh, I got a guitar, so he gives me a hand,
I never say a word about  Art Faller´s land.

Faller picked me up for the Rhode Island show
Stayed at his place, he´s as nice as they go.
Said, "You travel light and you don´t have a band,
Let me take you out and show you 
Some of  Art Faller´s land."

I asked about Gonzalez, says he knows him real good,
They used to tear around in the old neighbour(G)hood.
Said, he got a little funny and he called himself Dan,
He never took a drive 
Out to  Art Faller´s land,
He never took a drive out to  Art Faller´s land.

On the last tour, maybe nine months or so,
We stopped to get gas and a Yoo-Hoo to go
I asked Gonzalez, "Who calls you Dan?"
He snapped like a dog 
Goin´ to  take off your hand.
He said, "How should I know? Maybe some little man,
Keeps monkeys wearing speedos on Art Faller´s land.
 
He gets funny, so you don´t call him Dan,
And never say a word about  Art Faller´s land,
No, never say a word about  Art Faller´s land,
You never say a word, never say a word,
Never say a word about Art Faller´s land.
