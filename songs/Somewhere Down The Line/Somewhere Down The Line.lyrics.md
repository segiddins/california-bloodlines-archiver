We will find the golden road
Somewhere down the line
If we don't, we all were sold
Somewhere down the line
When we were young and we'd shine
And I believe it's getting closer all the time
We will find the golden road
Somewhere down the line

I will leave my worries go
Somewhere down the line
Live those dreams that I will sow
Somewhere down the line
When I was young and it'd shine
But I believe it's getting closer all the time
We will find the golden road
Somewhere down the line
Oh, somewhere down the line

Somewhere down the line
Somewhere down the line
When I was young and it'd shine
But I believe it's getting closer all the time
We will find the golden road
Somewhere down the line
Oh, somewhere down the line
