It's Rocket Roy in the real world
It's Rocket Roy and the true believer
Blaze and Diego and the Monkey Boy
Johnny Dreams and Missy Mary Thankful

It's Rocket Roy and the Time Cowboys
Lost somewhere between World War II and the new millenium,
between Blondie and Dagwood and Mulder and Sculley,
between the Hudson Hornet and the Mars Rover,
between the little red schoolhouse and Columbine

It's Rocket Roy and the Time Cowboys
Out there on the endless highway
with the long train of dreams
as the ghost of the Superchief
silently runs through the Illinois farmland
deep in the heart of a country
trying endlessly to remember itself
