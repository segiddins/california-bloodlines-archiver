There ain't no wild horses out on Wild Horse Road
There ain't no wild horses there, I know
Somewhere they're trucking mustangs on a lonesome desert road
But there ain't no wild horses out on Wild Horse Road

Looking at the long line behind the stallions
All the faithful mares
Just like women on the road
Everywhere
Following the big time
They caught a dead line
Where did they all go
There ain't no wild horses out on Wild Horse Road

There ain't no wild horses out on Wild Horse Road
There ain't no wild horses there, I know
Somewhere they're trucking mustangs on a lonesome desert road
But there ain't no wild horses out on Wild Horse Road

Running down a mustang oh, what'll it take
A pick up and a gun?
Hey young moonlight gunner
Where's the sun?
Don't it make you feel
Like kicking in a whitewall
Now you finally know
There ain't no wild horses out on Wild Horse Road

There ain't no wild horses out on Wild Horse Road
There ain't no wild horses there, I know
Somewhere they're trucking mustangs on a lonesome desert road
But there ain't no wild horses out on Wild Horse Road
