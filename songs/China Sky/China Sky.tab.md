In the Tanforan version there are a couple of
chord variants, often played higher up the neck.
If that poses a problem for you, play the “normal” chords.

Capo 2nd fret – so count “plus two” for fret positions below.

G* 
(mostly B and E strings, so D4 would sometimes do, too)

“Chinese” notes. Not that difficult to follow, but
I suggest playing the chord progression noted above –
you´ll be able to play along with the CD that way, too)
