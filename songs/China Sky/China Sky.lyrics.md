The Catman dances, Jakarta run
Taking chances, yeah, oh and I take none
And you know they fly in the China sky
Where I heard tell, Angels cry
For I heard tell, Angels cry

Flying tiger, circle low
And the midnight ride, smoking gold
Oh you know they fly in the China sky
And I heard tell, that's where Angels cry
And I heard tell, Angels cry
Oh, I heard tell, Angels cry

The Catman dances, Jakarta run
Taking chances, yeah, oh and I take none
And you know they fly in the China sky
Where I heard tell Angels cry
And I heard tell, Angels cry
And I heard tell
I heard tell
And I heard tell, Angels cry
