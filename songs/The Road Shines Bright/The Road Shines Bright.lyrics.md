Listen to the hymn in the high school gym
Cause the church burned down last night
Glory, Glory, Hallelujah
I can see the light

I got a church right here in side
And it does me quite all right
It shows me the road that goes to home
And I can see the light

And the road shines bright
And the road shines bright
Oh the road shines bright
When you're going home

Bless you long and lonesome highway
You're gonna save my life
Headlights shining in the cat eyes walking
And I can see the light

Glory, Glory, Hallelujah
I can see the light
Glory, Glory, Hallelujah
I can see the light

And the road shines bright
And the road shines bright
Oh the road shines bright
When you're going home

And the road shines bright
And the road shines bright
Oh the road shines bright
When you're going home

Glory, Glory, Hallelujah
I can see the light
Glory, Glory, Hallelujah
I can see the light
