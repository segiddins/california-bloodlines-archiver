He was born in East Virginia
North Carolina, he did roam
And there he met a fair young maiden
Her name and age, he did not know

Her hair it was, a soft brown color
Her lips they were, a ruby red
And on her breast, well she wore white linen
And there he longed to lay his head

I’d rather be in some dark hovel
Where the sun refused to shine
Than to see him with another
And to know that he won’t be mine

So I’m going down where we’d go wander
Down where the chase it meets the sea
But now his heart is with another
And he no longer dreams of me

He was born in East Virginia
