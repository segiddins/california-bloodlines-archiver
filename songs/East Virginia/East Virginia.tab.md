Capo 3rd

(Am)
He was born in East Virginia,
North Caro(G)lina, he did (Am)roam,
And there he met a fair young maiden,
Her name and (G)age, he did not (Am)know.

Her hair it was, a soft brown color,
Her lips they (G)were, a ruby (Am)red,
And on her breast, well she wore white linen,
And there he (G)longed to lay his (Am)head.

I'd rather be in some dark hovel
Where the (G)sun refused to (Am)shine,
Than to see him with another
And to (G)know that he won't be (Am)mine.

So I'm going down where we'd go wander,
Down where the (G)chase, it meets the (Am)sea,
But now his heart is with another,
And he no (G)longer dreams of (Am)me.

He was born in East Virginia...
