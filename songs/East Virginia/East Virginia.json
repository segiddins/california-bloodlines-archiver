    "Lyrics": "He was born in East Virginia\nNorth Carolina, he did roam\nAnd there he met a fair young maiden\nHer name and age, he did not know\n\nHer hair it was, a soft brown color\nHer lips they were, a ruby red\nAnd on her breast, well she wore white linen\nAnd there he longed to lay his head\n\nI’d rather be in some dark hovel\nWhere the sun refused to shine\nThan to see him with another\nAnd to know that he won’t be mine\n\nSo I’m going down where we’d go wander\nDown where the chase it meets the sea\nBut now his heart is with another\nAnd he no longer dreams of me\n\nHe was born in East Virginia\n\n",
