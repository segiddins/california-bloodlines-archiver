So long sitting by the roadside where the wind hides
Ah, when you lose your dreams
So long looking where the band goes, oh and she knows
It's a Hollywood dream
Hollywood, Hollywood
She believes she can find the sky

So long looking down the white line for the old right time
For the rainbow sign
So long looking where the band goes, oh and she knows
It's a Hollywood dream
Hollywood, Hollywood
She believes she can find the sky

Oh it's angels on the road
Who knows where they go?
And every day's an endless scheme of 
Take me back to my Hollywood dream
Hollywood, Hollywood
She believes she can find the sky

So long sitting by the roadside where the wind hides
Ah, when you lose your dreams
So long looking where the band goes, oh and she knows
It's a Hollywood dream
Hollywood, Hollywood
She believes she can find the sky

Oh it's angels on the road
Who knows where they go?
And every day's an endless scheme of
Take me back to my Hollywood dream
Hollywood, Hollywood
She believes she can find the sky

In Hollywood, in Hollywood
It's a Hollywood dream
