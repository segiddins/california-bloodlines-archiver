So many years I have pulled on the line
Fished in the river
Coming up dry
Dry river runs like a scar
On your soul
Have you ever been in Texas
With your lungs full of holes?

Run like coyote with a trap on your paw
All of my friends seem
To live outside the law
Work all your life
You've got nothing to show
Just some seeds in your pocket
That some fool said would grow

And you ride stone blind
And I ride stone blind
And I ride stone blind
Waiting for the sun to shine

The Bible said that the kingdom's come
I couldn't see it in the noon day sun
I've been looking for thirty-four years
I do believe that the kingdom's here

And I ride stone blind
And I ride stone blind
And I ride stone blind
And I ride stone blind
And I ride stone blind
And I ride stone blind
