So the light will shine for Joe
She alone will burn the coal
Pray for him, Joe, that old rolling stone
So the light will shine for Joe

She has seen him work so long
To try and the write the everlasting song
A whole lot of tears were riding on those rhymes
She knows he tries too hard sometimes

So the light will shine for Joe
She alone will burn the coal
And pray for him, Joe, that old rolling stone
So the light will shine for Joe

A hometown girl
With the world-wide eyes
Stands with Joe to watch the sky
Falling star never had the glow
Of the light that shines for Joe

So the light will shine for Joe
She alone will burn the coal
And pray for him, Joe, that old rolling stone
So the light will shine for Joe

So the light will shine for Joe
