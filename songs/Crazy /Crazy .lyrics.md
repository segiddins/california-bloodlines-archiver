Crazy lives in Tempe
Married three times that Crazy knows
One dude was a hustler
One dude was a drifter
One dude I heard tell
Crazy didn't know

You're crazy to let 'em use you
You're crazy to live alone
I will drive you, Crazy
If I see you by the road
'Cause I will know Crazy
You have gone

Yea, you've gone, Crazy
I believe there's hope for you
You've gone crazy
You've got to be to face the world
You've gone, Crazy
And I think of you
When I'm going too

Crazy to be lonely
Is just dying too damn slow
And Crazy, as it seems
You know to love somebody
Is just that, it's Crazy
The only way to go

Yea, you've gone, Crazy
I believe there's hope for you
You've gone crazy
You've got to be to face the world
You've gone, Crazy
And I think of you
When I'm going too
