She was born at the turn of the century it seems
Born from the world to awaken from a dream
It is out of her hands, it was meant to be
Oh you can't turn back Diana for it is your destiny
And I hope you're dancing yeah
And I hope you're dancing yeah

Oh, the love of the world is the wings of the saints
Who answer the call when the light is getting faint
But they show you no mercy, the merchants of pain
And there is no one alive who isn't speaking your name
And I hope you're dancing yeah
And I hope you're dancing yeah
To the music of the Angels and the dawning of the day
I hope you're dancing Diana
I hope you're dancing Diana

Oh, we must love one another, again it is heard
From Mother Calcutta who embodies the word
And humbled and shamed, bowed the head of the Queen
As you pass by Diana as if in a dream
And I hope you're dancing yeah
And I hope you're dancing yeah
To the music of the Angels and the dawning of the day
I hope you're dancing Diana

Oh, she died at the turn of the century they say
At the end of a chase near the Champs Elyesse
You will never grow old, you will never be scorned
In a flash in the tunnel and a legend was born
And I hope you're dancing yeah
And I hope you're dancing yeah
To the music of the Angels and the dawning of the day
I hope you're dancing Diana

I hope you're dancing Diana
I hope you're dancing Diana
I hope you're dancing Diana
