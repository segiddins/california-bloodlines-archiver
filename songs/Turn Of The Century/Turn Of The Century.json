    "Lyrics": "She was born at the turn of the century it seems\nBorn from the world to awaken from a dream\nIt is out of her hands, it was meant to be\nOh you can't turn back Diana for it is your destiny\nAnd I hope you're dancing yeah\nAnd I hope you're dancing yeah\n\nOh, the love of the world is the wings of the saints\nWho answer the call when the light is getting faint\nBut they show you no mercy, the merchants of pain\nAnd there is no one alive who isn't speaking your name\nAnd I hope you're dancing yeah\nAnd I hope you're dancing yeah\nTo the music of the Angels and the dawning of the day\nI hope you're dancing Diana\nI hope you're dancing Diana\n\nOh, we must love one another, again it is heard\nFrom Mother Calcutta who embodies the word\nAnd humbled and shamed, bowed the head of the Queen\nAs you pass by Diana as if in a dream\nAnd I hope you're dancing yeah\nAnd I hope you're dancing yeah\nTo the music of the Angels and the dawning of the day\nI hope you're dancing Diana\n\nOh, she died at the turn of the century they say\nAt the end of a chase near the Champs Elyesse\nYou will never grow old, you will never be scorned\nIn a flash in the tunnel and a legend was born\nAnd I hope you're dancing yeah\nAnd I hope you're dancing yeah\nTo the music of the Angels and the dawning of the day\nI hope you're dancing Diana\n\nI hope you're dancing Diana\nI hope you're dancing Diana\nI hope you're dancing Diana\n\n",
