This is the story as I remember it, of my first seeing Haley's Comet â€“ 
Of my seeing Haley's Comet. (D) (Em) This was in Lexington, Ken(D)tucky,
and I was living at the (Em)Transylvania Inn, (D)  the place I was (Em)born. 
(D) My mother was (Em)operating that inn.(D) My father was a horse trainer.(Em) 
It must have been (D) (Em) in the late spring (D)or early summer, (Em)
my mother came to me and said, (D) "Let's go (Em) upstairs (D) on the veranda." (Em)
She said, "I (D)want you to see Haley's Comet."(Em)
(D)And to me it was only (Em) another star, (D) (Em) so every (D)night I went up
and (Em)watched and (D)as it got closer, (Em) what I though was a (D)star, 
started to (Em)take on the look of a ball of fire with a tail behind it.

And as it came around, (A2)it got bigger and (Em)bigger and lower and (A2)lower,
(Em) Till finally one (A2)night (Em) it was over the (A2)Tattersall's barn.  (Em)
(A2) It looked like that it was just (Em)hovering over that barn 
and that it (A2)might fall (Em) at any minute. (A2) 
The (Em)horses in the barn were(A2)restless.
They were  (Em) thrashing around (A2) in the stalls.
(Em) They were nickering. (A2) It was a (Em)nicker of (A2)fear. (Em)
My father, (A2)several other men, (Em)went to the barn to try to quiet the (A2)horses.(Em) and I went to my mother (A2) and I said, Mother, I'm a(Em)fraid." (A2) 
She says, (Em) "So am I." (A2)  I said, "What can I (Em)do?"
(A2) She said,  "Well, (Em)ask God to (Em)spare us."
It was so (A2)bright  (Em) that there were (A2)dark shadows (Em)under the eves
of the (A2)barn.(Em) I don't think I can describe (A2)that eerie light.
(Em) It wasn't  (A2) pure white, (Em) (A2) it wasn't red, 
(Em) it just seemed like a light that reached your very soul.
