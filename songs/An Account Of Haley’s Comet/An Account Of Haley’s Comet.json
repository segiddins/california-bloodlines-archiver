    "Lyrics": "This is the story as I remember it, of my first seeing Haley's Comet - of\nmy seeing Haley's Comet.  This was in Lexington, Kentucky, and I was\nliving at the Transylvania Inn, the place I was born.  My mother was\noperating that Inn.  My father was a horse trainer.  It must have been in\nthe late spring or early summer, my mother came to me and said, \"Let's go\nupstairs on the veranda.\"  She said, \"I want you to see Haley's Comet.\" \nTo me it was only another star, so every night I went up and watched and\nas it got closer, what I though was a star, started to take on the look of\na ball of fire with a tail behind it.  \n\nKentucky light shine\nWill it fall from the sky?\nKentucky light shine\nStranger in the sky\nKentucky light shine\nWill it fall from the sky?\nKentucky light shine\nStranger in the sky\n\nAnd as it came around, it got bigger and bigger and lower and lower, till\nfinally one night it was over the Tattersall's barn.  It looked like that\nit just hovering over that barn and that it might fall at any minute. The\nhorses in the barn were restless. They were thrashing around in the\nstalls. They were nickering. It was a nicker of fear. My father,\nseveral other men, went to the barn to try to quiet the horses.  I went\nto my mother and I said, \"Mother, I'm afraid.\"  She says, \"So am I.\" I\nsaid, \"What can I do?\"  She said, \"Well, ask God to spare us.\" It was so\nbright that there were dark shadows under the eves of the barn. I don't\nthink I can describe that eerie light. It wasn't pure white, it wasn't\nred, it just seemed like a light that reached your very soul. \n\nKentucky light shine\nWill it fall from the sky?\nKentucky light shine\nStranger in the sky\nKentucky light shine\nWill it fall from the sky?\nKentucky light shine\nStranger in the sky\n\n",
