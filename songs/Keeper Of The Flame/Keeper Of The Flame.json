    "Lyrics": "The dogs now are on the streets of home\nThere's a wind upon the land.\nIf you can dream of highway signs,\nThan you know what is at hand\n\nChorus:\nWhen the one brave angel flies at dawn\nWould you even know her name?\nWho will stand upon the shore?\nThe keeper of the flame.\n\nShots rang out and the rains came down\nThen the hopeless hit the floor\nThere was one great shout across the land\nI don't need this anymore\n\nAnd if one brave angel flies at dawn\nWould you even know his name?\nWho will stand upon the shore?\nThe keeper of the flame.\n\nFreedom is an endless word\nWe are always wanting more\nThere are heroes in the holy hearts\nAnd they fight the holy wars.\n\nAnd the one brave angel flies at dawn\nWould you even know her name?\nWho will stand upon the shore?\nThe keeper of the flame.\n(Repeat Chorus)\n\n",
