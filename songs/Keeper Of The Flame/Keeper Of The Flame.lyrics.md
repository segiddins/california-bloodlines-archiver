The dogs now are on the streets of home
There's a wind upon the land.
If you can dream of highway signs,
Than you know what is at hand

Chorus:
When the one brave angel flies at dawn
Would you even know her name?
Who will stand upon the shore?
The keeper of the flame.

Shots rang out and the rains came down
Then the hopeless hit the floor
There was one great shout across the land
I don't need this anymore

And if one brave angel flies at dawn
Would you even know his name?
Who will stand upon the shore?
The keeper of the flame.

Freedom is an endless word
We are always wanting more
There are heroes in the holy hearts
And they fight the holy wars.

And the one brave angel flies at dawn
Would you even know her name?
Who will stand upon the shore?
The keeper of the flame.
(Repeat Chorus)
