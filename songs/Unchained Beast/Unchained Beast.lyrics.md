When the third world rises from the flames
Without faces and without names
And the battle cry is take the planes
When the third world rises from the flames

When the third world rises from the grave
Saying "We want ours, oh, you all will pay"
'Cause every dog will have his day
When the third world rises from the grave

You can't find, no, you can only hear
One Mosquito in your ear
And the holy wars in the Middle East
Forever more, the unchained beast
The unchained beast

And the Shite gunmen take the air
For the evening news goes everywhere
And if they all go down, why would they care
When the Shite gunmen take the air

Beirut, Frankfurt, felt the sting
For dying children cannot sing
The anthems of the burning wings
Beirut, Frankfurt, felt the sting

You can't find, you can only hear
One Mosquito in your ear
And the holy wars in the Middle East
Forever more, the unchained beast
The unchained beast

From the birth place of
From the birth place of
From the birth place of
The Prince of Peace
