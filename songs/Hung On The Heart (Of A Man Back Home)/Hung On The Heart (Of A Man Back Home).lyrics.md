She could have gone to Colorado
We were riding on that road
I said "I'm going, will you follow?"
She said "Yes," but then said "No"

She's hung on the heart of a man back home
She's got the heart of a rolling stone
Hung on the heart of a man back home

We'd spend our time mostly just laughing
But not enough time to make a day
You should have seen her eyes when I was asking
"Do you ever feel like running away?"

She's hung on the heart of a man back home
She's got the heart of a rolling stone
Hung on the heart of a man back home

La la la la la la la la
Hung on the heart of a man back home

We saw the road house lights were burning
We heard the music of the band
She said  "Come on honey let's go dancing"
And I just had to understand

She's hung on the heart of a man back home
She's got the heart of a rolling stone
Hung on the heart of a man back home

She's hung on the heart of a man back home
She's got the heart of a rolling stone
Hung on the heart of a man back home

She's hung on the heart of a man back home
She's got the heart of a rolling stone
Hung on the heart of a man back home

La la la la la la la la
Hung on the heart of a man back home
