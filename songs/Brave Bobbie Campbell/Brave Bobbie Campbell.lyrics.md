The cry of the raven rang over the morn
The drums were calling the clans to war
A lad, Bobbie Campbell, wept for the dead
Remembered the words that his father had said

"Never forget who you are, my son
Never dishonor the clan.
For your fathers before you have died in the field
Died for our green pasture land"

They rolled out the cannon and summoned their men
The women were praying they'd come home again
But it's goodbye my Mary I'm goin' to war
Fight for the honor of the son that you bore

"Never forget who you are, my son
Never dishonor the clan.
For your fathers before you have died in the field
Died for our green pasture land"

The pipes they are still. A victory's in hand
Now his Mary knows peace in the land
And over the glen lies brave Bobbie Campbell
The gun still clutched in his hand

"Never forget who you are, my son
Never dishonor the clan.
For your fathers before you have died in the field
Died for our green pasture land"
