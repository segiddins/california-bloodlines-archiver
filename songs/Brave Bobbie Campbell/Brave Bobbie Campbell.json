    "Lyrics": "The cry of the raven rang over the morn\nThe drums were calling the clans to war\nA lad, Bobbie Campbell, wept for the dead\nRemembered the words that his father had said\n\n\"Never forget who you are, my son\nNever dishonor the clan.\nFor your fathers before you have died in the field\nDied for our green pasture land\"\n\nThey rolled out the cannon and summoned their men\nThe women were praying they'd come home again\nBut it's goodbye my Mary I'm goin' to war\nFight for the honor of the son that you bore\n\n\"Never forget who you are, my son\nNever dishonor the clan.\nFor your fathers before you have died in the field\nDied for our green pasture land\"\n\nThe pipes they are still. A victory's in hand\nNow his Mary knows peace in the land\nAnd over the glen lies brave Bobbie Campbell\nThe gun still clutched in his hand\n\n\"Never forget who you are, my son\nNever dishonor the clan.\nFor your fathers before you have died in the field\nDied for our green pasture land\"\n\n",
