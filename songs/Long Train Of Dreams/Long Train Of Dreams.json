    "Lyrics": "I am a traveler,\nI am riding through time,\nI have a ticket to the end of the line.\nLights of the city are passing in blue,\nI stare at reflections searching for you.\n\nStopped off at Heartbreak,\nIt was back down the line.\nIn the Hotel of Tears, I spent some hard times.\nI've seen that life is not what it seems,\nOn the long track of lies runs the long train of dreams.\n\nI'm riding the liner, the Lonesome Express,\nThe end of the line is our only address.\nI'm riding the liner all silver and clean,\nOn the long track of lies runs the long train of dreams.\nOn the long track of lies runs the long train of dreams.\n\nComfort the porter's\nTaking good care.\nHave no compartment, asleep in the chair.\nI dream of a stranger who captures my soul,\nI hear the wheels singing through years as we roll.\n\nI walk through the Pullman\nOn my way to the bar,\nAt the end of the train in the desperate car.\nIn the dark of the tunnel the hiss of the steam\nReminds me I'm riding the long train of dreams.\n\nI'm riding the liner, the Lonesome Express,\nThe end of the line is our only address.\nI'm riding the liner all silver and clean,\nOn the long track of lies runs the long train of dreams.\nOn the long track of lies runs the long train of dreams.\n\nI have faith you will find me\nOr I will find you.\nIn the lights of the station of all that is true\nI search for a stranger with eyes who are kind.\nI'll hold you forever at the end of the line.\n\nI'm riding the liner, the Lonesome Express,\nThe end of the line is our only address.\nI'm riding the liner all silver and clean\nOn the long track of lies runs the long train of dreams.\nI'm riding the liner all silver and clean,\nOn the long track of lies runs the long train of dreams.\nOn the long track of lies runs the long train of dreams.\n\n",
