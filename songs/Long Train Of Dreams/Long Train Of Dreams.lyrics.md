I am a traveler,
I am riding through time,
I have a ticket to the end of the line.
Lights of the city are passing in blue,
I stare at reflections searching for you.

Stopped off at Heartbreak,
It was back down the line.
In the Hotel of Tears, I spent some hard times.
I've seen that life is not what it seems,
On the long track of lies runs the long train of dreams.

I'm riding the liner, the Lonesome Express,
The end of the line is our only address.
I'm riding the liner all silver and clean,
On the long track of lies runs the long train of dreams.
On the long track of lies runs the long train of dreams.

Comfort the porter's
Taking good care.
Have no compartment, asleep in the chair.
I dream of a stranger who captures my soul,
I hear the wheels singing through years as we roll.

I walk through the Pullman
On my way to the bar,
At the end of the train in the desperate car.
In the dark of the tunnel the hiss of the steam
Reminds me I'm riding the long train of dreams.

I'm riding the liner, the Lonesome Express,
The end of the line is our only address.
I'm riding the liner all silver and clean,
On the long track of lies runs the long train of dreams.
On the long track of lies runs the long train of dreams.

I have faith you will find me
Or I will find you.
In the lights of the station of all that is true
I search for a stranger with eyes who are kind.
I'll hold you forever at the end of the line.

I'm riding the liner, the Lonesome Express,
The end of the line is our only address.
I'm riding the liner all silver and clean
On the long track of lies runs the long train of dreams.
I'm riding the liner all silver and clean,
On the long track of lies runs the long train of dreams.
On the long track of lies runs the long train of dreams.
