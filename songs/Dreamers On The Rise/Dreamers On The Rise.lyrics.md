Ah, once
We were dreamers on the rise
We were the sun
Where the sun never shines
And we were gold
Where the night bird only flies
Oh, that's a long time you know
For that kind of wind to blow
A long time ago
We were dreamers on the rise

And twice
We said we'd begin again
And we made a vow
That we'd remain as friends
And fallen down
We said we shall rise again
Ah, that's a long time you know
For that kind of wind to blow
A long time ago
We were dreamers on the mend
A long time ago
We were dreamers on the mend

And if three
Wishes came into my life
I'd say one
Was to gaze into your eyes
And I'd say two
Would be turning back our lives
And three's a long way to go
For that kind of wind to blow
A long time ago
We were dreamers on the rise
A long time ago
We were dreamers on the rise
A long time ago
We were dreamers on the rise
