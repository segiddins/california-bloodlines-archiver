    "Lyrics": "Ah, once\nWe were dreamers on the rise\nWe were the sun\nWhere the sun never shines\nAnd we were gold\nWhere the night bird only flies\nOh, that's a long time you know\nFor that kind of wind to blow\nA long time ago\nWe were dreamers on the rise\n\nAnd twice\nWe said we'd begin again\nAnd we made a vow\nThat we'd remain as friends\nAnd fallen down\nWe said we shall rise again\nAh, that's a long time you know\nFor that kind of wind to blow\nA long time ago\nWe were dreamers on the mend\nA long time ago\nWe were dreamers on the mend\n\nAnd if three\nWishes came into my life\nI'd say one\nWas to gaze into your eyes\nAnd I'd say two\nWould be turning back our lives\nAnd three's a long way to go\nFor that kind of wind to blow\nA long time ago\nWe were dreamers on the rise\nA long time ago\nWe were dreamers on the rise\nA long time ago\nWe were dreamers on the rise\n\n",
