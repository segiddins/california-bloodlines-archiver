    "Lyrics": "Oh her voice was cracked and broken\nBut somehow she sang the song\nAnd she clung to every word\nBut she couldn't hold them long\nThey could crash about her heart\nWhere she cradled them so long\n\nWaiting for her hero from the war\nWaiting for her hero from the war\nShe's been waiting now\nTwenty years or more\n\nAnd she read to me the letter\nTurning yellow in the light\nRead to me the letter\nNow engraved upon her sight\nI believe she almost hears \nA bugle in the night\n\nWaiting for her hero from the war\nWaiting for her hero from the war\nShe's been waiting now\nTwenty years or more\n\nWaiting for her hero from the war\nWaiting for her hero from the war\nShe's been waiting now\nTwenty years or more\n\n",
