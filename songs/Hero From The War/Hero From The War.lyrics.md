Oh her voice was cracked and broken
But somehow she sang the song
And she clung to every word
But she couldn't hold them long
They could crash about her heart
Where she cradled them so long

Waiting for her hero from the war
Waiting for her hero from the war
She's been waiting now
Twenty years or more

And she read to me the letter
Turning yellow in the light
Read to me the letter
Now engraved upon her sight
I believe she almost hears 
A bugle in the night

Waiting for her hero from the war
Waiting for her hero from the war
She's been waiting now
Twenty years or more

Waiting for her hero from the war
Waiting for her hero from the war
She's been waiting now
Twenty years or more
