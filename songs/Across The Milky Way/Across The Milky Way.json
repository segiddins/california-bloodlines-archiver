    "Lyrics": "If you are lost as in a dream and you cannot find your way\nAll the reasons you are lost will guide you on your way\nIf you turn them all to stars, across the milky way\nTruly they would make all the night as bright as day\n\nChildren come and children go, they're not children any more\nAnd all I have are photographs, I've got hundreds on my door\nAnd if I turned them all to stars, across the milky way\nTruly they would make all the night as bright as day\nTruly they would make all the night as bright as day\n\nAnd if all the hearts that the spirit loves were standing side by side\nThey would be forever long, and ten thousand miles wide\nTurn them all to stars, across the milky way\nTruly they would make all the night as bright as day\nTruly they would make all the night as bright as day\n\nThe light that shines in your true love's eyes, also shines in you\nIf we would only let it shine, the promise would come true\nYou could turn us all to stars, across the milky way\nTruly they would make all the night as bright as day\nTruly they would make all the night as bright as day\nTruly they would make all the night as bright as day\n\n",
