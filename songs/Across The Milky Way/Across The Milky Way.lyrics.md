If you are lost as in a dream and you cannot find your way
All the reasons you are lost will guide you on your way
If you turn them all to stars, across the milky way
Truly they would make all the night as bright as day

Children come and children go, they're not children any more
And all I have are photographs, I've got hundreds on my door
And if I turned them all to stars, across the milky way
Truly they would make all the night as bright as day
Truly they would make all the night as bright as day

And if all the hearts that the spirit loves were standing side by side
They would be forever long, and ten thousand miles wide
Turn them all to stars, across the milky way
Truly they would make all the night as bright as day
Truly they would make all the night as bright as day

The light that shines in your true love's eyes, also shines in you
If we would only let it shine, the promise would come true
You could turn us all to stars, across the milky way
Truly they would make all the night as bright as day
Truly they would make all the night as bright as day
Truly they would make all the night as bright as day
