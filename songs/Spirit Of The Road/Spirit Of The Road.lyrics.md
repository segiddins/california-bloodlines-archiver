Chorus:
I’m looking for the spirit
Looking for the spirit 
I’m looking for the spirit of the road
I’m looking for the spirit
Am I anywhere that’s near it?
I’m looking for the spirit of the road.

In the shadows of the dinners
And the windows of streamliners
I’m looking for the spirit of the road
From the shadows of twin arrows
And the ghosts that walk the barrow
I’m looking for the spirit of the road

(Repeat Chorus)

And the dogs with hungry eyes
And the black crows where she flies
I’m looking for the spirit of the road
From the virgin of the highway
To the truckers going my way
I’m looking for the spirit of the road

In the two lanes in Texsola
And the signs for Coca Cola
I’m looking for the spirit of the road
And the highway runs around it
As a boy is where I found it
I’m looking for the spirit of the road

(Repeat Chorus)
