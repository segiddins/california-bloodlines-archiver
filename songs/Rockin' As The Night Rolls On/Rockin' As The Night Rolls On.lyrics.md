Friday night is breaking
And I’m working till a quarter to five
Gonna give the world fair warning
We’re going to celebrate being alive

Out on the misty morning
When the last brave star is gone
You can’t go wrong with a rock ‘n roll song
Rockin’ as the night rolls on

Hot rods out on the highway
Caravan gone mad
Annie on the seat beside me
It’ll be the best night we ever had

And on to the misty morning
When the straights all rise at dawn
You can’t go wrong with a rock ‘n roll song
Rockin’ as the night rolls on

Rockin’ as the night rolls on
Rockin’ as the night rolls on
You can’t go wrong with a rock ‘n roll song
Rockin’ as the night rolls on

Annie can you drown a heartache
This boy’s going to try
Five days workin’ for the weekend
For thrills that you just can’t buy

Then it’s on to the misty morning
Oh Annie when we’re drained and gone
You can’t go wrong with a rock ‘n roll song
Rockin’ as the night rolls on

Rockin’ as the night rolls on
Rockin’ as the night rolls on
You can’t go wrong with a rock ‘n roll song
Rockin’ as the night rolls on
