    "Lyrics": "Friday night is breaking\nAnd I’m working till a quarter to five\nGonna give the world fair warning\nWe’re going to celebrate being alive\n\nOut on the misty morning\nWhen the last brave star is gone\nYou can’t go wrong with a rock ‘n roll song\nRockin’ as the night rolls on\n\nHot rods out on the highway\nCaravan gone mad\nAnnie on the seat beside me\nIt’ll be the best night we ever had\n\nAnd on to the misty morning\nWhen the straights all rise at dawn\nYou can’t go wrong with a rock ‘n roll song\nRockin’ as the night rolls on\n\nRockin’ as the night rolls on\nRockin’ as the night rolls on\nYou can’t go wrong with a rock ‘n roll song\nRockin’ as the night rolls on\n\nAnnie can you drown a heartache\nThis boy’s going to try\nFive days workin’ for the weekend\nFor thrills that you just can’t buy\n\nThen it’s on to the misty morning\nOh Annie when we’re drained and gone\nYou can’t go wrong with a rock ‘n roll song\nRockin’ as the night rolls on\n\nRockin’ as the night rolls on\nRockin’ as the night rolls on\nYou can’t go wrong with a rock ‘n roll song\nRockin’ as the night rolls on\n\n",
