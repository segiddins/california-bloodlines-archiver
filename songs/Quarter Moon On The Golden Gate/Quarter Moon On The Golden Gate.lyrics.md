Oh it happened down in Texas, near the town of San Antoine
He was driving to Virginia who would call him on the phone
She said "Sam, I can hardly wait
To see the quarter moon on the golden gate
Oh, to see the quarter moon on the golden gate"

Virginia's in the bedroom putting on the dress
The one she got on sale today that showed her off the best
She said "Sam, oh don't be late
I want to see the quarter moon on the golden gate
I want to see the quarter moon on the golden gate"

And the rains and winds in Texas, they can blow
And I've seen the water run so hard that a man could lose the road
Taking it slow, playing it safe
On his way to the quarter moon on the golden gate
On his way to the quarter moon on the golden gate

Oh it's been fourteen years, maybe fourteen years or more
She sits by the window, and a chair beside the door
And she says "Sam, I'll forever wait
To see the quarter moon on the golden gate
To see the quarter moon on the golden gate
To see the quarter moon on the golden gate
To see the quarter moon on the golden gate
