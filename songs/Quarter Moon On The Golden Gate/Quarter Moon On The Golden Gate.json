    "Lyrics": "Oh it happened down in Texas, near the town of San Antoine\nHe was driving to Virginia who would call him on the phone\nShe said \"Sam, I can hardly wait\nTo see the quarter moon on the golden gate\nOh, to see the quarter moon on the golden gate\"\n\nVirginia's in the bedroom putting on the dress\nThe one she got on sale today that showed her off the best\nShe said \"Sam, oh don't be late\nI want to see the quarter moon on the golden gate\nI want to see the quarter moon on the golden gate\"\n\nAnd the rains and winds in Texas, they can blow\nAnd I've seen the water run so hard that a man could lose the road\nTaking it slow, playing it safe\nOn his way to the quarter moon on the golden gate\nOn his way to the quarter moon on the golden gate\n\nOh it's been fourteen years, maybe fourteen years or more\nShe sits by the window, and a chair beside the door\nAnd she says \"Sam, I'll forever wait\nTo see the quarter moon on the golden gate\nTo see the quarter moon on the golden gate\nTo see the quarter moon on the golden gate\nTo see the quarter moon on the golden gate\n\n",
