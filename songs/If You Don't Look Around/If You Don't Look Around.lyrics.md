They told me, "Don't ya go down to that city
Don't go down to that city I say
Oh, there's trouble there for sure
And it's no concern of yours"
And that's all I had to hear them people say

If you don't look around
You won't see me a goin'
You won't see me a goin' that way
If you don't look around
You have no way of knowin'
I don't think you even know what I say

And I saw children just walking along and singing
When a voice from behind me rang through
And I saw an ugly man with a mad dog in his hand
He said, "Stand right there. I'll turn him loose on you"

If you don't look around
You won't see me a goin'
You won't see me a goin' that way
If you don't look around
You have no way of knowin'
I don't think you even know what I say

So don't tell me there ain't no time for singing
I don't need no empty words from you
If they're saying, "Who ain't free?"
Then, they're saying it right to me
So, go back home. I'll wake you when we're through

If you don't look around
You won't see me a goin'
You won't see me a goin' that way
If you don't look around
You have no way of knowin'
I don't think you even know what I say

They told me, "Don't ya go down to that city
Don't go down to that city I say
Oh, there's trouble there for sure
And it's no concern of yours"
And that's all I had to hear them people say

If you don't look around
You won't see me a goin'
You won't see me a goin' that way
If you don't look around
You have no way of knowin'
I don't think you even know what I say
