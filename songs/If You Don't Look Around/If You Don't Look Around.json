I'll turn him loose on you\"\n\nIf you don't look around\nYou won't see me a goin'\nYou won't see me a goin' that way\nIf you don't look around\nYou have no way of knowin'\nI don't think you even know what I say\n\nSo don't tell me there ain't no time for singing\nI don't need no empty words from you\nIf they're saying, \"Who ain't free?\"\nThen, they're saying it right to me\nSo, go back home. I'll wake you when we're through\n\nIf you don't look around\nYou won't see me a goin'\nYou won't see me a goin' that way\nIf you don't look around\nYou have no way of knowin'\nI don't think you even know what I say\n\nThey told me, \"Don't ya go down to that city\nDon't go down to that city I say\nOh, there's trouble there for sure\nAnd it's no concern of yours\"\nAnd that's all I had to hear them people say\n\nIf you don't look around\nYou won't see me a goin'\nYou won't see me a goin' that way\nIf you don't look around\nYou have no way of knowin'\nI don't think you even know what I say\n\n",
