Oh the sun shines bright on my old Kentucky home
On my old Kentucky home far away

Oh the sun shines bright over old Kentucky
Over old Kentucky on the derby day
They let him run, they let the big horse run
Please Mrs Tweedy
I saw him on the T.V.
Send him out to run in the California sun

And let him run, let him run
Let me see the big horse run
Let him run, let him run
Let him run, let him run

Swaps, Citation, Man O'War
Never saw a horse like that before
Let him run, let the big horse run
Running is an itch
He's got to scratch
No offence to old Dan Patch

But let him run, let him run
Let me see the big horse run
Let him run, let him run
Let him run, let him run

Spending his time in the field with the ladies
In the field with the ladies he can't complain
But let him run, oh let the big horse run
One more time
Out on the track
Saddle the wind and get up on his back

And let him run, let him run
Let me see the big horse run
Let him run, let him run
Let him run, let him run
