Oh Manual, I must go riding
I must go down to Mazatlan
See Manuel, the sparrow's flying
Shadows on the ground over Mazatlan

Oh Manuel, she loves another
Mi corazon lost in Mazatlan
I will take her from the arms
Of my own brother
Tonight I ride down to Mazatlan

Mazatlan, Mazatlan, Maria
Mazatlan, Mazatlan, my song
Mazatlan, Mazatlan, Maria my song
Dark eyed girl, Maria is waiting
Dark eyed girl, Maria is waiting
Dark eyed girl, Maria is waiting

And I will ride like the wind
Coming up from the canyon 
On a hot summer night in September
Oh Manuel I will pray
To the great god speed
That Maria remembers

Mazatlan, Mazatlan, Maria
Mazatlan, Mazatlan my song
Mazatlan, Mazatlan, Maria my song
Dark eyed girl, Maria is waiting
Dark eyed girl, Maria is waiting
Dark eyed girl, Maria is waiting
