    "Lyrics": "Bertha overheated goin’ down to LA,\nI found I had been drivin’ in the heat of the day.\nPulled on over to the side of the road.\nBertha’s makin’ noises like she’s gonna explode.\nStopped to get some water,\nWound up with the daughter\nOf the guy they call Texaco Joe.\n\nWell she got a little bored she said, \"What do you do\"?\n\"Im a rock ‘n’ roll monkey like you see in the zoo.\"\nShe said, \"I never heard you but I’d like to some day.\nMaybe you could come to my high school and play.\"\nOh send me a top ten tune will you, Lord.\nI could buy a new motor for my 52 Ford.\n\nYeah, Bertha keep a rollin’,\nLittle girl get goin’.\nGotta get me down to LA.\n\nGot an agent, got a manager, accountant and such\nBut I ain’t got the money, Lord, to buy a new clutch.\nWell meaning people, I’ll let it be known\nThat I am gonna make it if I make it alone.\nGot a six oclock soundcheck, I’m meeting the band.\nTjis is the story of a six stringed medicine man.\n\nYeah, Bertha keep a rollin’,\nLittle girl get goin’.\nGotta get me down to LA.\n\n",
