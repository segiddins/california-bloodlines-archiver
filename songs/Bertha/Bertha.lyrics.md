Bertha overheated goin’ down to LA,
I found I had been drivin’ in the heat of the day.
Pulled on over to the side of the road.
Bertha’s makin’ noises like she’s gonna explode.
Stopped to get some water,
Wound up with the daughter
Of the guy they call Texaco Joe.

Well she got a little bored she said, "What do you do"?
"Im a rock ‘n’ roll monkey like you see in the zoo."
She said, "I never heard you but I’d like to some day.
Maybe you could come to my high school and play."
Oh send me a top ten tune will you, Lord.
I could buy a new motor for my 52 Ford.

Yeah, Bertha keep a rollin’,
Little girl get goin’.
Gotta get me down to LA.

Got an agent, got a manager, accountant and such
But I ain’t got the money, Lord, to buy a new clutch.
Well meaning people, I’ll let it be known
That I am gonna make it if I make it alone.
Got a six oclock soundcheck, I’m meeting the band.
Tjis is the story of a six stringed medicine man.

Yeah, Bertha keep a rollin’,
Little girl get goin’.
Gotta get me down to LA.
