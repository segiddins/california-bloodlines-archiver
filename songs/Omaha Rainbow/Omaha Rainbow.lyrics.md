Keeping my eyes on the Omaha rainbow
Making the rain go, out of my way
Keeping my eyes on the Omaha Rainbow
Going down the same roads, as my younger days

And I remember the name, Ernesto Juarez
Wherever the man says, we got to go
There's going to be a change, Ernesto Juarez
But it's a long way to August, I got a lot of roads to go

Yeah, and even if I go, out to California
I've got to warn you, what I'm going to say
Yeah, and even if I go, out to California
It's a long way to August, picking up friends along the way

So keep your eyes on that far distant star
And the sun's gonna to shine where you are
Oh keep your eyes on that far distant star
And the sun's gonna to shine where you are

Keeping my eyes on the Omaha rainbow
Making the rain go, out of my way
Keeping my eyes on the Omaha Rainbow
Going down the same roads, as my younger days
