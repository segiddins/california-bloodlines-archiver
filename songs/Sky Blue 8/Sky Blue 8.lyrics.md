Oh it happened down in Texas,
Near the town of San Antone,
He was driving to Virginia,
She had called him on the phone.

She said "Sam, oh don't be late,
Let me see your pickup, painted Sky Blue 8."

Virginia, she's in the bedroom,
Putting on her dress,
The one she bought on sale that day,
That shows her off the best.

Singing, "Sam, I can hardly wait,
To see your pickup, painted Sky Blue 8."

But the rains and winds of Texas sure can blow,
And I've seen the water run so hard 
A man can lose the road.

Takin' it slow, playin' it safe,
”Oh, let me see your pickup, painted Sky Blue 8.”

It's been 14 years,
Maybe 14 years or more,
She sits by the window
In a chair beside the door.

Singing "Sam, you're forever late...
Let me see your pickup, painted Sky Blue 8. 
Let me see your pickup, painted Sky Blue 8, 
See your pickup painted...
Oh, Sky Blue 8.
