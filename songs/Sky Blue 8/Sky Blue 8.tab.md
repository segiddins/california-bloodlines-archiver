(G5) (G) (G5) (G) (G5) (G) (C)(G)(D) 2x
Oh it (G)happened down in Texas,
Near the (D)town of San Antone,
He was (G)driving (G/F#)to Vir(Em)ginia,
She had (C)called him on the (D)phone.

She said (Em)"Sam, oh don't be (Bm)late,
Let me (C)see your pickup, (D)painted Sky Blue (G)8."
-Instr. like intro 1x-

Vir(G)ginia, she's in the bedroom,
(D)Putting on her dress,
The (G)one she (G/F#)bought on (Em)sale that day,
That (C)shows her off the (D)best.

Singing, (Em)"Sam, I can hardly (Bm)wait,
To (C)see your pickup, (D)painted Sky Blue (G)8."
-Instr. Like intro 1x-

But the (C)rains and winds of (D)Texas sure can (G)blow,
And I've (C)seen the water (D)run so hard 
A (G)man can (G/F#)lose the (Em)road.

Takin' it (D)slow, playin' it (Em)safe,
”Oh, (C)let me see your pickup, (D)painted Sky Blue (G)8.”
-Instr. 1x-

(G)It's been 14 years,
Maybe (D)14 years or more,
(G)She sits (G/F#)by the (Em)window
In a (C)chair beside the (D)door.

Singing (Em)"Sam, you're forever (Bm)late...
Let me (C)see your pickup, (D)painted Sky Blue (G)8.(G/F#) (Em)
Let me (C)see your pickup, (D)painted Sky Blue (G)8,(G/F#) (Em)
(C)See your pickup (D)painted...(hold)
