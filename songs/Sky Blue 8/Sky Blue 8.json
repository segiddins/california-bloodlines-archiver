    "Lyrics": "Oh it happened down in Texas,\nNear the town of San Antone,\nHe was driving to Virginia,\nShe had called him on the phone.\n\nShe said \"Sam, oh don't be late,\nLet me see your pickup, painted Sky Blue 8.\"\n\nVirginia, she's in the bedroom,\nPutting on her dress,\nThe one she bought on sale that day,\nThat shows her off the best.\n\nSinging, \"Sam, I can hardly wait,\nTo see your pickup, painted Sky Blue 8.\"\n\nBut the rains and winds of Texas sure can blow,\nAnd I've seen the water run so hard \nA man can lose the road.\n\nTakin' it slow, playin' it safe,\n”Oh, let me see your pickup, painted Sky Blue 8.”\n\nIt's been 14 years,\nMaybe 14 years or more,\nShe sits by the window\nIn a chair beside the door.\n\nSinging \"Sam, you're forever late...\nLet me see your pickup, painted Sky Blue 8. \nLet me see your pickup, painted Sky Blue 8, \nSee your pickup painted...\nOh, Sky Blue 8.\n\n",
