    "Lyrics": "I'm sorry that I hit you with the car\nI never meant for things to go that far\nLet's forget it ever happened, and go out on the town\n'Cause you can't let little things get you down\n\nI'm sorry that I cut off all your hair\nIt seemed like such a funny idea with you just sleeping there\nLet's forget it ever happened, and go out on the town\n'Cause you can't let little things get you down\n\nI'm sorry that I turned your mother on\nLast time that I saw her she was dancing naked on the lawn\nLet's forget it ever happened, and go out on the town\n'Cause you can't let little things get you down\n\n",
