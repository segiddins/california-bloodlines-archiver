I'm sorry that I hit you with the car
I never meant for things to go that far
Let's forget it ever happened, and go out on the town
'Cause you can't let little things get you down

I'm sorry that I cut off all your hair
It seemed like such a funny idea with you just sleeping there
Let's forget it ever happened, and go out on the town
'Cause you can't let little things get you down

I'm sorry that I turned your mother on
Last time that I saw her she was dancing naked on the lawn
Let's forget it ever happened, and go out on the town
'Cause you can't let little things get you down
