How could you go, Virginia 
And play that drifter's game
He sold to you the thunder 
Was cannons in the rain
And all his Holy Roads 
Were sidetracks just the same
Still you believe the thunder 
Are cannons in the rain
Cannons in the rain

Your Don Quixote's windmills 
Were giants in his eyes
To see things as they really are
It can only make you wise
And all his Holy Roads 
Were sidetracks just the same
Still you believe the thunder
Are cannons in the rain
Cannons in the rain

And all his Holy Roads 
Were sidetracks just the same
Still you believe the thunder
Are cannons in the rain
Are cannons in the rain
