Nine men to guard the (A)British rank
And (D)five to watch the (A)town about,
And (D)two to (A)stand at (D7)either (G)hand,
And (D)one to let Bill (A)Tenor (D)out.    (A) (D)

He had eighty weight of(A)Spanish iron
Be(D)tween his neckbone (A)and his knee,
And (D)Billy took (A)Johnny up (D7)under his (G)arm,
And he (D)lugged him away quite (A)manful(D)ly.

And Billy broke locks and (A)Billy broke bolts,
And (D)Billy broke all that (A)he came nigh,
Un(D)til he (A)came to the (D7)dungeon (G)door,
And (D)that he broke right (A)manful-(D)aye.

So he stole him a horse and a(A)way did ride,
And (D)ooh, but they rode (A)gallantly,
Un(D)til he (A)came to the (D7)river (G)bank,
To the (D)river running (A)wild and (D)free.

The British were coming close (A)on their heels,
And (D)ooh, but they stood (A)fearfully,
'Til (D)Billy took (A)Johnny up(D7)on his (G)back,
And he (D)carried him over it (A)easi(D)ly.

And Billy broke locks and (A)Billy broke bolts,
And (D)Billy broke all that (A)he came nigh,
Un(D)til he (A)came to the (D7)dungeon (G)door,
And (D)that he broke right (A)manful-(D)aye.

So they (D)called at the inn for a (A)room to dance,
And (D)ooh, but they danced (A)merrily.
And the (D)very best (A)dancer a(D7)mong them (G)all
Was (D)old John Webb who was (A)just set (D)free.(HOLD!)
