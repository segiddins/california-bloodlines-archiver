Nine men to guard the British ranks
And five to watch the town about
And two to stand at either hand
And one to let old Tenor out

He stole a horse and away it did ran
Oh, but they rode gallantly
Until he came to the river bank
To the river running wild and free

And Billy broke locks and Billy broke bolts
And Billy broke all that he came nigh
Until he came to the dungeon door
And that he broke right manfully

He had eighty weight of Spanish iron
Between his neckbone and his knee
And Billy took Johnny upon his back
And he carried him over it easily

And Billy broke locks and Billy broke bolts
And Billy broke all that he came nigh
Until he came to the dungeon door
And that he broke right manfully
