See the star, it's almost blinding
For Mary's baby boy
So the shepards all will find him
Mary's baby boy

See the kings who came to see him
Mary's baby boy
And those three kings will kneel before him
Mary's baby boy

Born in a manger, born in Bethlehem
Mary's baby boy
Laid in a manger, born in Bethlehem
On a Christmas morn

Silver angels singing to him
Mary's baby boy
Hear them singing, "Alleluia"
To Mary's baby boy

And they will call the baby Jesus
Mary's baby boy
He will heal and he will save us
Mary's baby boy

Born in a manger, born in Bethlehem
Mary's baby boy
Laid in a manger, born in Bethlehem
On a Christmas morn

See the Star, it's almost blinding
For Mary's baby boy
So the shepards all will find him
Mary's baby boy

Mary's baby boy
