I was talkin' to a man about a movie show
Oh, won't you take me to Durango
I could play that part just fine, you know
So won't you take me down to Mexico

Take me down, down, down
Won't you take me to Durango
Take me down, down, down
Oh, take me down to Mexico

I never saw old Peckinpah
I guess he forgot to call
I can understand using Rita's man
He'll be the best Billy Kid of them all

So they took him down, down, down
Ah, they took him to Durango
They took him down, down, down
Oh, took him down to Mexico

Now Billy the Kid, I know what you did
Got a postcard on my wall
They were selling around
The New Mexico Town
Where they lowered him down

And they took him down, down, down
Oh, they took him down in New Mexico
Down, down, down
Oh, shot him down in New Mexico

Now I was talking to a man about a movie show
Oh, won't you take me to Durango
I could play that part just fine, you know
Won't you take me down to Mexico

Ah take me down, down, down
Won't you take me to Durango
Take me down, down, down
Oh, take me down to Mexico
