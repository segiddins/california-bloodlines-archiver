    "Lyrics": "Crossing your heart, you have blood on your hands\nYou have mud on your shoes, you are making a stand\nAnd you are running the race, and your only prize\nIs you've found you a reason to rise\nFinding the reasons to rise\n\nTo carve out a face on a mountain of stone\nDay after day, one man alone\nAnd it took twenty years just to get to his eyes\nBut he's found him a reason to rise\nFinding the reasons to rise\n\nThen you must realize, that you're not telling lies\nIf it's crazy that shines in your eyes\nThen you must realize, on a star in the sky\nYou've found you a reason to rise\nFinding the reasons to rise\n\nHere's what you do when you give it your all\nAnd there's nowhere to run and you're too weak to crawl\nWith a pain in your heart and tears in your eyes\nYou just find you a reason to rise\nFinding a reason to rise\n\nFinding a reason to rise\n\n",
