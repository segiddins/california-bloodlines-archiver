Crossing your heart, you have blood on your hands
You have mud on your shoes, you are making a stand
And you are running the race, and your only prize
Is you've found you a reason to rise
Finding the reasons to rise

To carve out a face on a mountain of stone
Day after day, one man alone
And it took twenty years just to get to his eyes
But he's found him a reason to rise
Finding the reasons to rise

Then you must realize, that you're not telling lies
If it's crazy that shines in your eyes
Then you must realize, on a star in the sky
You've found you a reason to rise
Finding the reasons to rise

Here's what you do when you give it your all
And there's nowhere to run and you're too weak to crawl
With a pain in your heart and tears in your eyes
You just find you a reason to rise
Finding a reason to rise

Finding a reason to rise
