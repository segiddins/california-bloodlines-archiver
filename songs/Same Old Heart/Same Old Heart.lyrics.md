Crazy is the night
Living for the day
One more hour
Will come our way
Lightning strikes
Dark clouds part
A brand new love
Same old heart

Second chance running
A one time track
Lovers of the world
I am back
Well, all right
I’ve got the part
A brand new love
Same old heart

Same old heart
Brand new love
Same old sky
Stars above
Just one life
That’s all it was
Same old heart
A brand new love

One by one
Two by two
Sky full of lovers
Till I met you
Honey, when I know
I’m not that smart
A brand new love
Same old heart

Same old heart
Brand new love
Same old sky
Stars above
Just one you
That’s all it was
Same old heart
A brand new love
