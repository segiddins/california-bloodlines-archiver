Yeah, I got wheels to keep rolling
I got a mind to keep going
I got a good friend by the name of Rosalie
I got my two-time totalled car
I got my good eye on a star
I got a heart full of woman
And a belly full of Tennessee

And it's on down the road
Though the gas is getting low
I got a good friend and she's sitting next to me
Yeah, the back end rubs the ground
And it rains when the top comes down
I got a heart full of woman
And a belly full of Tennessee

I got a heart full of woman
And a belly full of Tennessee

Yeah I got wheels to keep rolling
I got a mind to keep going
I got a good friend by the name of Rosalie
I got my two-time totalled car
I got my good eye on a star
I got a heart full of woman
And a belly full of Tennessee
