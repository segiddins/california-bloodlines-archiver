I'm sleepin' less in L. A.
Dreaming of days yet to come
Oh and I don't care what you say
I know that those days are sure to come
And I'm wakin' and I'm callin'
And I'm shakin' and I'm fallin'
And oh little darlin'
Wonder when those sweet dreams will come

There's a hole in the sky
Made by my Right Guard last night
Oh and then there's you and I
Assuring that everythings all right
Nursing, pretending,
Cursing then depending
And yet, it's neverending
Makes 'ya wonder when those sweet dreams will come

Looking for some love
I guess that's why people buy dogs
Is there someone up above?
And I wonder is the Captain keeping logs
I'm cursing and I'm praying
Not knowin' what we're saying
And yet, it's everydaying
And I wonder when those sweet dreams will come

I feel like a fire
In the morning when the fire is out
I am walking on the wire
And the wire's what the whole thing is about
The pretender is spinning
Surrender is winning
And yet, it's a beginning
To feel like those sweet dreams will come

The pretender is spinning
Surrender is winning
And yet, it's beginning
To feel like those sweet dreams will come

Oh little darlin'
Don't cha wonder when those sweet dreams will come

Oh, sweet dreams will come
Oh, sweet dreams will come
Oh, sweet dreams will come
