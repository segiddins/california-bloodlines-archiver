A.\nDreaming of days yet to come\nOh and I don't care what you say\nI know that those days are sure to come\nAnd I'm wakin' and I'm callin'\nAnd I'm shakin' and I'm fallin'\nAnd oh little darlin'\nWonder when those sweet dreams will come\n\nThere's a hole in the sky\nMade by my Right Guard last night\nOh and then there's you and I\nAssuring that everythings all right\nNursing, pretending,\nCursing then depending\nAnd yet, it's neverending\nMakes 'ya wonder when those sweet dreams will come\n\nLooking for some love\nI guess that's why people buy dogs\nIs there someone up above?\nAnd I wonder is the Captain keeping logs\nI'm cursing and I'm praying\nNot knowin' what we're saying\nAnd yet, it's everydaying\nAnd I wonder when those sweet dreams will come\n\nI feel like a fire\nIn the morning when the fire is out\nI am walking on the wire\nAnd the wire's what the whole thing is about\nThe pretender is spinning\nSurrender is winning\nAnd yet, it's a beginning\nTo feel like those sweet dreams will come\n\nThe pretender is spinning\nSurrender is winning\nAnd yet, it's beginning\nTo feel like those sweet dreams will come\n\nOh little darlin'\nDon't cha wonder when those sweet dreams will come\n\nOh, sweet dreams will come\nOh, sweet dreams will come\nOh, sweet dreams will come\n\n",
