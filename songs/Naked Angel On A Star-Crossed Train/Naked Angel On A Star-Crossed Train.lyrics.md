Naked angel on a star-crossed train
Riding the bright light homeward
Naked angel on a star-crossed train
Riding the bright light homeward

An angel brings the rain
When she feels like crying
An angel brings the pain
When she feels like dying
And an angel brings the songs
I can feel 'em coming on
I cry out her name
I cry out, "Delilah"

Naked angel on a star-crossed train
Riding the bright light homeward
Naked angel on a star-crossed train
With a guitar man and an Angel Band
Sending me songs and here's one

An angel is the muse
And the musing brings the spirit
I can not refuse
If she sings you know I'll hear it
An angel brings the songs
I can feel 'em coming on
I cry out her name
I cry out, "Delilah"

Naked angel on a star-crossed train
Riding the bright light homeward
Naked angel on a star-crossed train
Riding the bright light homeward
Naked angel on a star-crossed train
Riding the bright light homeward
Naked angel on a star-crossed train
With a guitar man and an Angel Band
Playing me songs, you'll hear one
