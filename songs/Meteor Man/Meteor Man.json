    "Lyrics": "Year of the comet\nEclipse of the moon\nWas anybody on it?\nDid it descend too soon\nFell out of the sky, it\nLanded in a mall\nHe said, \"I'm gonna buy it.\"\nIt was so very small.\n\nNow he's got it in his hand\nNow he's got it in his hand\nNow he's got it in his hand\nHe's the Meteor Man\nHe's the Meteor Man\n\nI'm a circus boy in Dixieland\n\nArizona sighting\nLights in the sky\nIt was so exciting\nNobody knows why\n\"You gotta have a piece of\nEternity\", he said\nHe put it on his VISA\nKeeps it by his bed\n\nNow he's got it in his hand\nNow he's got it in his hand\nNow he's got it in his hand\nHe's the Meteor Man\nHe's the Meteor Man\n\nI'm a circus boy in Dixieland\n\nOh, ten million years\nOh, ten million years\n\nThe healer came from China\nHe is smoking in the yard\nThere are people in a line\nHe is holding all the cards\nThe painter with the voodoo\nIs keeping out of sight\nHe is locked up in his bedroom\nIt sings to him at night\n\nNow he's got it in his hand\nNow he's got it in his hand\nNow he's got it in his hand\nHe's the Meteor Man\nHe's the Meteor Man\n\nAnd I'm a circus boy in Dixieland\n\nOh, ten million years\nOh, ten million years\n\nNow he's got it in his hand\nNow he's got it in his hand\nNow he's got it in his hand\nHe's the Meteor Man\nHe's the Meteor Man\nHe's the Meteor Man\n\nAnd I'm a circus boy in Dixieland\nWell I'm a circus boy in Dixieland\nWell I'm a circus boy\nHe's the Meteor Man\n\n",
