Year of the comet
Eclipse of the moon
Was anybody on it?
Did it descend too soon
Fell out of the sky, it
Landed in a mall
He said, "I'm gonna buy it."
It was so very small.

Now he's got it in his hand
Now he's got it in his hand
Now he's got it in his hand
He's the Meteor Man
He's the Meteor Man

I'm a circus boy in Dixieland

Arizona sighting
Lights in the sky
It was so exciting
Nobody knows why
"You gotta have a piece of
Eternity", he said
He put it on his VISA
Keeps it by his bed

Now he's got it in his hand
Now he's got it in his hand
Now he's got it in his hand
He's the Meteor Man
He's the Meteor Man

I'm a circus boy in Dixieland

Oh, ten million years
Oh, ten million years

The healer came from China
He is smoking in the yard
There are people in a line
He is holding all the cards
The painter with the voodoo
Is keeping out of sight
He is locked up in his bedroom
It sings to him at night

Now he's got it in his hand
Now he's got it in his hand
Now he's got it in his hand
He's the Meteor Man
He's the Meteor Man

And I'm a circus boy in Dixieland

Oh, ten million years
Oh, ten million years

Now he's got it in his hand
Now he's got it in his hand
Now he's got it in his hand
He's the Meteor Man
He's the Meteor Man
He's the Meteor Man

And I'm a circus boy in Dixieland
Well I'm a circus boy in Dixieland
Well I'm a circus boy
He's the Meteor Man
