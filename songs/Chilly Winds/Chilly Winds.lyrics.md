Oh, I'm goin' where them chilly winds don't blow
Gonna find a true love
That is where I want to go
Out where them chilly winds don't blow

Leavin' in the spring time
Won't be back 'till fall
And if I can forget you
I might not come back at all
Out where them chilly winds don't blow

Wish I was a headlight
On a west bound train
I'd shine my light on
Cool Colorado rain
Out where the chilly winds don't blow

Oh, I'm goin' where them chilly winds don't blow
Gonna find a true love
That is where I want to go
Out where them chilly winds don't blow

Sing you a song
Sing it soft and low
Sing it for you, baby
And then I'll have to go

Oh, I'm goin' where them chilly winds don't blow
Gonna find a true love
That is where I want to go
Out where them chilly winds don't blow

ADDITIONAL LYRICS - 

If you’re feeling lonely.
If you’re feeling low.
Remember that I loved you
More than you will ever know
Out where them chilly winds don’t blow.
