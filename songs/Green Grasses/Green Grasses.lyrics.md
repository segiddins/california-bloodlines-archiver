Way out on a lonely bayou
There waits a girl where the green grasses grow
Waits she there with a tear in her eye
Dreaming of years that long have gone by

How I yearn for the days that are gone
When I’d wake in the morning to a whippoorwill song
There by the fires sits my lady fair
Singing this song as she combs her long hair

She'd sing, way out on a lonely bayou
There waits a girl where the green grasses grow
Waits she there with a tear in her eye
Dreaming of years that long have gone by

Now I’m thinking home I must go
‘Cause I’ve been out here where the four winds blow
Leaving tonight with the big April moon
She’ll be at my side by the third day of June

Way out on a lonely bayou
There waits a girl where the green grasses grow
Waits she there with a tear in her eye
Dreaming of years that long have gone by

Way out on a lonely bayou
There waits a girl where the green grasses grow
Waits she there with a tear in her eye
Dreaming of years that long have gone by
Dreaming of years that long have gone by
