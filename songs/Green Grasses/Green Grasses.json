    "Lyrics": "Way out on a lonely bayou\nThere waits a girl where the green grasses grow\nWaits she there with a tear in her eye\nDreaming of years that long have gone by\n\nHow I yearn for the days that are gone\nWhen I’d wake in the morning to a whippoorwill song\nThere by the fires sits my lady fair\nSinging this song as she combs her long hair\n\nShe'd sing, way out on a lonely bayou\nThere waits a girl where the green grasses grow\nWaits she there with a tear in her eye\nDreaming of years that long have gone by\n\nNow I’m thinking home I must go\n‘Cause I’ve been out here where the four winds blow\nLeaving tonight with the big April moon\nShe’ll be at my side by the third day of June\n\nWay out on a lonely bayou\nThere waits a girl where the green grasses grow\nWaits she there with a tear in her eye\nDreaming of years that long have gone by\n\nWay out on a lonely bayou\nThere waits a girl where the green grasses grow\nWaits she there with a tear in her eye\nDreaming of years that long have gone by\nDreaming of years that long have gone by\n\n",
