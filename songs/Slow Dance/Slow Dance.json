    "Lyrics": "Green eyes and summer moonlight\nBlue moon in a summer's sky\nThe future in moment's glances\nHeaven in a lover's eye\n\nFriday falls like warm moonbeam\nMonday falls and the rain is cold\nAnd Friday falls like sweet sunshine\nSaturday falls like gold \n\nChorus:\nFor a slow dance in a blue blue moon\nA slow dance as the river runs\nOne chance came none to soon\nFor a slow dance in a blue blue moon\n\nMusic's like a midnight railroad\nElectric as a dance hall band\nSlow dance is a blues in moonlight\nMoonlight is a lover's hand\n\nDreaming in blue blue shadows\nHolding someone four four time\nDancing in a million shadows\nDancing in a lover's eye\n\n(Repeat Chorus)\n\n\n",
