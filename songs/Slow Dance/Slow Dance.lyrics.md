Green eyes and summer moonlight
Blue moon in a summer's sky
The future in moment's glances
Heaven in a lover's eye

Friday falls like warm moonbeam
Monday falls and the rain is cold
And Friday falls like sweet sunshine
Saturday falls like gold 

Chorus:
For a slow dance in a blue blue moon
A slow dance as the river runs
One chance came none to soon
For a slow dance in a blue blue moon

Music's like a midnight railroad
Electric as a dance hall band
Slow dance is a blues in moonlight
Moonlight is a lover's hand

Dreaming in blue blue shadows
Holding someone four four time
Dancing in a million shadows
Dancing in a lover's eye

(Repeat Chorus)
