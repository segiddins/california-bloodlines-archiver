All the times I've run
When we've just begun
We lost the midnight sun
In the dream

And all the times I cried
All the times I tried
To make a lame bird fly
In the sun

If all the lights break through
Shades of afternoon
All the dreams were you
Everyone

So I ride the tired road
Every story I have told
Is just all as it seems
Broken roses, weathered dreams

And all the days run clean
Faces on the screen
Don't know what it means
But I'm playing it through

And all the times I've run
When we've just begun
Lost the midnight sun
In the dream

And I ride the tired road
Every story I have told
And it's just all as it seems
Broken roses, weathered dreams
And the broken roses, weathered dreams
