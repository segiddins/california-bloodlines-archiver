Rose water
Eastern daughter
Jasmine lady in the western sun
Rose water
Something's got her
Chasing shadows where there are none

Valiums and hearty
An L.A. party
Topanga music on the radio
Hearty and downers
An out of towner
Lady asking which way to go

And it's all in good time
Just one day at a time
Oh, it's all in good time
'Cause when you're young
Just like the sun
It goes so quickly by

And it's all in good time
Just one day at a time
Oh, it's all in good time
'Cause when you're young
Just like the sun
You feel you'll never die

Rose water
Eastern daughter
Jasmine lady in the western sun
Rose water
Something's got her
Chasing shadows where there are none
