    "Lyrics": "There was a woman \nI saw on the street,\nI swear she was wearing \nThe moon on her  feet.\nShe said, \"Do you know me?\"\nAnd I said, \"I don't know.\"\nShe told me to listen\nAnd then I could go.  \n\nAnd there was a boy \nWho I found on the road,\nI said, \"Are you lost \nWith nowhere to go?\"\nAnd he said, \"No I'm not,\nI believe that you are.\"\nAnd he told me to sit \nOn the hood of the car.  \n\nHe said, \"I am the course \nThat the river is winding,\nAnd I am the horse \nThat the angel is riding,\nAnd I am the source \nOf the love you are finding.\nDo you know who I am?\nIt is blinding, \nI am the star\nIn the black sky shining.\"\n\nThere was a dog \nWho had followed me home,\nHe was not young,\nBut not fully grown.\nAnd he said, “Do you know me?\nWe spoke on the phone,\nI was a king \nAnd the world is my throne.”  \n\nHe said, ”I am the flame \nIn the heat of the fire,\nAnd I am to blame \nFor the tongue of the liar,\nAnd I am the same \nAs the birds on the wire.\nDo you know who I am?\nIt is blinding, \nI am the star   \nIn the black sky shining.”\n\nAnd there was a thief \nWho was tied to a pole,\nAt his feet was a list \nOf the things that he stole.\nAnd I said, “I am only \nPlaying a role.”\nAnd he asked if I dared \nLook deep in his soul. \n\nHe said, ”I am the heart \nOf the warrior child,\nAnd I am the moment \nThat the beast becomes mild,\nAnd I am the part \nOf the soul that is wild. \nDo you know who I am?\nIt is blinding,\nI am the star\nIn the black sky shining, oh.\n\nAnd I come from the light,\nIt is blinding, \nFor I am the star    \nIn the black sky shining, oh.\n\n",
