There was a woman 
I saw on the street,
I swear she was wearing 
The moon on her  feet.
She said, "Do you know me?"
And I said, "I don't know."
She told me to listen
And then I could go.  

And there was a boy 
Who I found on the road,
I said, "Are you lost 
With nowhere to go?"
And he said, "No I'm not,
I believe that you are."
And he told me to sit 
On the hood of the car.  

He said, "I am the course 
That the river is winding,
And I am the horse 
That the angel is riding,
And I am the source 
Of the love you are finding.
Do you know who I am?
It is blinding, 
I am the star
In the black sky shining."

There was a dog 
Who had followed me home,
He was not young,
But not fully grown.
And he said, “Do you know me?
We spoke on the phone,
I was a king 
And the world is my throne.”  

He said, ”I am the flame 
In the heat of the fire,
And I am to blame 
For the tongue of the liar,
And I am the same 
As the birds on the wire.
Do you know who I am?
It is blinding, 
I am the star   
In the black sky shining.”

And there was a thief 
Who was tied to a pole,
At his feet was a list 
Of the things that he stole.
And I said, “I am only 
Playing a role.”
And he asked if I dared 
Look deep in his soul. 

He said, ”I am the heart 
Of the warrior child,
And I am the moment 
That the beast becomes mild,
And I am the part 
Of the soul that is wild. 
Do you know who I am?
It is blinding,
I am the star
In the black sky shining, oh.

And I come from the light,
It is blinding, 
For I am the star    
In the black sky shining, oh.
