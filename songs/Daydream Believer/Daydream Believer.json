    "Lyrics": "If I could hide 'neath the wings\nOf the bluebird as she sings\nThe six o'clock alarm would never ring\nBut it rings and I rise\nRub the sleep out of my eyes\nThe shaving razor's old and it stings\n\nBut cheer up, sleepy Jean\nAh, what can it mean\nTo a daydream believer \nAnd a homecoming queen\n\nYou once thought of me\nAs a white knight on his steed\nBut now you know how funky I can be\nAnd our good times start and end\nWithout dollar one to spend\nBut how much, baby, do we really need\n\nSo cheer up, sleepy Jean\nAh, what can it mean\nTo a daydream believer \nAnd a homecoming queen\n\nCheer up, sleepy Jean\nAh, what can it mean\nTo a daydream believer \nAnd a homecoming queen\n\n",
