If I could hide 'neath the wings
Of the bluebird as she sings
The six o'clock alarm would never ring
But it rings and I rise
Rub the sleep out of my eyes
The shaving razor's old and it stings

But cheer up, sleepy Jean
Ah, what can it mean
To a daydream believer 
And a homecoming queen

You once thought of me
As a white knight on his steed
But now you know how funky I can be
And our good times start and end
Without dollar one to spend
But how much, baby, do we really need

So cheer up, sleepy Jean
Ah, what can it mean
To a daydream believer 
And a homecoming queen

Cheer up, sleepy Jean
Ah, what can it mean
To a daydream believer 
And a homecoming queen
