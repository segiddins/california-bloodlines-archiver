L.A. hey, it's a hard time town
L.A. hey, it's a goldrush town
L.A. hey, I said, L.A. hey
L.A. hey, it's a hard time town

So many dreams are shattered on the streets here
So many hearts are battered under feet here
All it really means, nothing really matters here
L.A. hey, it's a hard time town

Don't you think we should go away tomorrow?
Sail away, hitch a ride on the wind
Listen to the sound of our dreams on the frown
L.A. hey, it's a hard time town

L.A. hey, it's a hard time town
L.A. hey, it's a goldrush town
L.A. hey, I said, L.A. hey
L.A. hey, it's a hard time town

L.A. hey, it's a hard time town
L.A. hey, it's a goldrush town
L.A. hey, I said, L.A. hey
L.A. hey, it's a hard time town
