He broke his back
To put the food on the table
In Columbus Ohio he said to his wife
"I believe that the flag
It was more than a rag
But the outlaws in office
Have shattered my life"

Can you hear me Ohio?
You are the country
You are the nation
You will survive
Can you hear me Ohio?
You are the country
You are the nation
You will survive

Children in Cheyenne
Are taught in their schools
Believe in the country
Don't break any rules
But the T.V. is on and they
Know something's wrong
Someone must tell them
To keep pushing on

Can you hear me Wyoming?
You are the country
You are the nation
You will survive
Can you hear me Wyoming?
You are the country
You are the nation
You will survive

Devils and angels
Belong in the church
You try for the best
And you deal with the worst
Just keep on plugging
You old nine to five
For you are the heartbeat
That keeps us alive

Can you hear me Virginia?
You are the country
You are the nation
You will survive

Can you hear me Dakota?
Can you hear me Colorado?
Can you hear me California?
Can you hear me Wisconsin?
Can you hear me Arizona?
Can you hear me in Georgia?
Can you hear me in Texas?
Can you hear me Hawaii?
Can you hear me Alaska?

You are the country
You are the nation
You will survive
