"And there'd be old men standing at the back of the crowd who seemed to
remember America being born." (Intro on The Last Campaign)

Cody sang to me
A song about the great Montana sky
Cody sang to me
And I could see Montana in his eyes
And I could see Montana in his eyes

Cody’s hair is long
And dirty as the rivers of L.A.
Cody’s mind is gone
You never know just what he’s gonna say
No, you never know just what he’s gonna say

See him fall out on the road
Oh, won’t you go and help him on his way
See him fall out on the road
The forgotten son of some old yesterday
The forgotten son of some old yesterday

Cody starts to tell
How he led the wagons to the sea
Cody starts to yell
And he waves his gnarled hand to follow me
And he waves his gnarled hand to follow me

He’s been living for so long
Cody’s begging please take me away
He’s been living for so long
The forgotten son of some old yesterday

Cody sang to me
A song about the great Montana sky
Cody sang to me
And I could see Montana in his eyes
I could see Montana
I could see Montana in his eyes
