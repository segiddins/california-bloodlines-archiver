    "Lyrics": "Hot desert highways, cadillac towns\nA circus of cowboys and honky tonk clowns\nEvangeline waits, from the window she stares.\nCool summer dresses are all that she wears.\n\nA loud neon jukebox, a rustle of coins\nIn the jeans of pretenders\nThey are hard living boys\nWho are playing the song of those who have lost\nTheir hearts and their lives, it's part of the cost\n\nChorus:\nEvangeline waits\nIn the cool of the night\nLike a caged nightingale\nDreaming of flight.\n\nI stand by the highway, call out your name\nIn every city or town, my questions the same\nHave you seen any angels,\nWho got lost in the wind?\nI'd give anything, to see her again.\n\n(Repeat Chorus)\n\n\n",
