Hot desert highways, cadillac towns
A circus of cowboys and honky tonk clowns
Evangeline waits, from the window she stares.
Cool summer dresses are all that she wears.

A loud neon jukebox, a rustle of coins
In the jeans of pretenders
They are hard living boys
Who are playing the song of those who have lost
Their hearts and their lives, it's part of the cost

Chorus:
Evangeline waits
In the cool of the night
Like a caged nightingale
Dreaming of flight.

I stand by the highway, call out your name
In every city or town, my questions the same
Have you seen any angels,
Who got lost in the wind?
I'd give anything, to see her again.

(Repeat Chorus)
