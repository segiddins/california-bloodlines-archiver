You long to see Cheyenne
And it's all right, it's all right with me
Your song be all that I am
And it's all right, it's all right with me

Only once around
Then they nail the top down
On the long wooden box in the ground
Only once around
You know all that I've found
Has been here in our own hometown

You long to see Cheyenne
And it's all right, it's all right with me
Your song be all that I am
And it's all right, it's all right with me

I never had a job
Where the boss didn't steal
The bass drum from his own brass band
Don't you think I know
That we're both growing old
I can tell by the veins in your hand

You long to see Cheyenne
And it's all right, it's all right with me
Your song be all that I am
And it's all right, it's all right with me

You long to see Cheyenne
To see Cheyenne
To see Cheyenne
