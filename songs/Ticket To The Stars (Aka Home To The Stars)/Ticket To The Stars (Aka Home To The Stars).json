    "Lyrics": "Oh there is a train and it runs by my room\nAnd it wakes me up in the middle of the night\nAt the arch of the rising moon\nIt says \"Do you know who you are?\nDo you know where you're going?\nWill you survive, yeah\nIn the fire when the wind is blowing?\"\n\nAh, there is a train and it runs by my room\nAnd the train is called reality\nAnd it's coming way too soon\nWay too soon for a guy\nWho is living on the lies\nLooking for the short cut\nAnd the secrets to survive\n\nAnd there are forces to guide you\nSpirits beside you\nRivers to ride you home to the stars\nAnd there are forces to guide you\nSpirits beside you\nRivers to ride you home to the stars\n\nThere is a voice shouting in my head\nAnd there is a voice\nThat is singing there instead\nAnd there is a choice\nTo which one will I listen\nFor one the road is long and hard\nThe other yeah, the road will glisten\n\nAnd not a day goes by that I don't think I'm crazy\nAnd not a day goes by\nThat the answers don't seem hazy\nSometimes I'm lost and I'm down and out\nBut then I'm lost and lazy\nBut if I were lost in the middle of the light\nYou know it would surely save me\nBe saved\nAnd this guy who is living on the lies\nLooking for a short cut\nAnd the secret to survive\nAnd there are forces to guide you\nSpirits beside you\nRivers to ride you home to the stars\nAnd there are forces to guide you\nSpirits beside you\nRivers to ride you home to the stars\n\nAnd there are forces to guide you\nSpirits beside you\n Rivers to ride you home to the stars\nAnd there are forces to guide you\nSpirits beside you\nRivers to ride you home to the stars\n\nBelieving in the stars\nAnd living in the stars\nAnd dying in the stars\nAnd home to the stars\n\nGet your ticket to the stars\nGet your ticket to the stars\n\n",
