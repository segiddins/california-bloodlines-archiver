Oh there is a train and it runs by my room
And it wakes me up in the middle of the night
At the arch of the rising moon
It says "Do you know who you are?
Do you know where you're going?
Will you survive, yeah
In the fire when the wind is blowing?"

Ah, there is a train and it runs by my room
And the train is called reality
And it's coming way too soon
Way too soon for a guy
Who is living on the lies
Looking for the short cut
And the secrets to survive

And there are forces to guide you
Spirits beside you
Rivers to ride you home to the stars
And there are forces to guide you
Spirits beside you
Rivers to ride you home to the stars

There is a voice shouting in my head
And there is a voice
That is singing there instead
And there is a choice
To which one will I listen
For one the road is long and hard
The other yeah, the road will glisten

And not a day goes by that I don't think I'm crazy
And not a day goes by
That the answers don't seem hazy
Sometimes I'm lost and I'm down and out
But then I'm lost and lazy
But if I were lost in the middle of the light
You know it would surely save me
Be saved
And this guy who is living on the lies
Looking for a short cut
And the secret to survive
And there are forces to guide you
Spirits beside you
Rivers to ride you home to the stars
And there are forces to guide you
Spirits beside you
Rivers to ride you home to the stars

And there are forces to guide you
Spirits beside you
 Rivers to ride you home to the stars
And there are forces to guide you
Spirits beside you
Rivers to ride you home to the stars

Believing in the stars
And living in the stars
And dying in the stars
And home to the stars

Get your ticket to the stars
Get your ticket to the stars
