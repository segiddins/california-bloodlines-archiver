Oh, (D/F#)there is a train, 
And it (G)runs by my (A)room,
And it (D/F#)wakes me up in the (G)middle of the night
At the (G/B)arc of the rising (A)moon.
It says "Do you (D/F#)know who you are?
Do you (G)know where you're (A)going?
(D/F#) Will you sur(G)vive, yeah
In the (G/B)fire when the wind is (A)blowing?"

And (D/F#)there is a voice, 
(G)Shouting in my (A)head,
And (D/F#)there is a voice
That is (G)singing there in(A)stead,
And there is a (D)choice,
Ah, to (G)which one will I (A)listen?
For the (D/F#)one the road is (G)long and hard,
For the (G/A)other, yeah, the road will (A)glisten. 
(Accentuate high notes: C#-D-E-C#-B-A) 

And (D/F#)not a day goes by 
(G)I don't think I'm (A)crazy,
And (D/F#)not a day goes by 
When the (G)answers don't seem (A)hazy.
Some(D/F#)times I'm lost and I'm (G)down and out,
But (G/B)then I'm lost and (A)lazy.
But if (D/F#)I were lost in the (G) middle of the light
You (G/A)know it would surely (A)save me.
