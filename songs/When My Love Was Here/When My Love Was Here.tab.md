Capo 2nd fret 
  
I (Cj7)thought I’d spend a (Dm7)week or two 
(Cj7)Where we went last (Am7)year, 
The (C)little cottage (Dm7)and the lake 
(D7)That we held so (G7)dear. 
  
But the (C)trees all (Am)seemed much (Dm)greener, (G7) 
Much (C)greener (Am)than this (Dm)year, (G7) (Cj7) 
Thinking a(Em)bout last (Am)summer, (Dm) 
When my (G7)love was (C)here. (Am) (Dm) (G7) 
  
And the (C)stars all (Am)lost their (Dm)glitter, (G7) 
(Cj7) They were so (Am)full of (Dm)cheer, (G7) (Cj7) 
Thinking a(Em)bout last (Am)summer, (Dm) 
When my (G)love was (C)here. (C7) 
  
(F)Even the (Dm7)old care(Cj7)taker, 
Who (Am)brought us from the (Dm)train, (G7) 
(Cj7) Says, “This (Am)year just (Dm)hasn’t, (D7) 
It hasn’t seemed the (G)same.” (G7) 
  
And the (C)winds a(Am)cross the (Dm)meadow (G7) 
(Cj7) Seem to (Am)hide a (Dm)tear, (G7) (Cj7) 
Thinking a(Em)bout last (Am)summer, 
(Dm)When my (G)love was (C)here. (C7) 
(F) (Dm) (Cj7) (Am) (Am7) (Dm) (G7) (C) (Am) (Dm) 
(D7) It hasn’t seemed the (G)same. (G7) 
  
And the (C)winds a(Am)cross the (Dm)meadow (G7) 
(Cj7) Seem to (Am)hide a (Dm)tear, (G7) (Cj7) 
Thinking a(Em)bout last (Am)summer, 
(Dm)(hold)When my (G7)(hold)love... was (C)here. (Am) (Dm) (G) (Cj7)
