I thought I'd spend a week or two
Where we went last year
The little cottage and the lake
That we held so dear

But the trees all seemed much greener
Much greener than this year
Thinking about last summer
When my love was here

And the stars all lost their glitter
They were so full of cheer
Thinking about last summer
When my love was here

Even the old caretaker
Who brought us from the train
Says, "This year just hasn't,
It hasn't seemed the same."

And the winds across the meadow
Seem to hide a tear
Thinking about last summer
When my love was here

It hasn't seemed the same.

And the winds across the meadow
Seem to hide a tear
Thinking about last summer
When my love was here
