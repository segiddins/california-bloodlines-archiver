Good earth rider singing
And his songs are all the same
I can laugh and I can cry
And I can feel the pain
Good earth rider singing
What his two good eyes can see
That across the hills from Placerville
The wind sure can feel free

In the stinking concrete cities
Oh, I never do feel clean
The air is dirt and the ladies' skirts
Are enough to make me mean
Good earth riders look around
And I think that you'll agree
That across the hill from Placerville
The wind sure can feel free

Good earth rider singing
And his songs are all to clear
I'm alone, love me please
Does anybody hear?
Good earth riders all the same
Looking to be free
And across the hill from Placerville
The wind sure calls to me

Yeah, across the hill from Placerville
The wind sure can feel free
