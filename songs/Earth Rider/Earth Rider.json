    "Lyrics": "Good earth rider singing\nAnd his songs are all the same\nI can laugh and I can cry\nAnd I can feel the pain\nGood earth rider singing\nWhat his two good eyes can see\nThat across the hills from Placerville\nThe wind sure can feel free\n\nIn the stinking concrete cities\nOh, I never do feel clean\nThe air is dirt and the ladies' skirts\nAre enough to make me mean\nGood earth riders look around\nAnd I think that you'll agree\nThat across the hill from Placerville\nThe wind sure can feel free\n\nGood earth rider singing\nAnd his songs are all to clear\nI'm alone, love me please\nDoes anybody hear?\nGood earth riders all the same\nLooking to be free\nAnd across the hill from Placerville\nThe wind sure calls to me\n\nYeah, across the hill from Placerville\nThe wind sure can feel free\n\n",
