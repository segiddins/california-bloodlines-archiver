    "Lyrics": "All of my life I've been no damn good\nCalled every lady in the neighbourhood\nBut, ooh, baby, I bring it on home to you\nGood time girls they don't mean a thing\nWhen I hear that fire bell ring\nOoh baby, I bring it on home to you\n\nYeah, when I get too mean and down\nGonna turn this big machine around\nAnd, ooh, baby, I bring it on home to you\n\nBalling on the road is a poor man's score\nLike a hungry coyote licking at your door\nAnd, ooh, baby, I bring it on home to you\n\nYeah, when I get too mean and down\nGonna turn this big machine around\nAnd, ooh, baby, I bring it on home to you\n\nOh, when I get too mean and down\nGonna turn this big machine around\nAnd, ooh, baby, bring it on home to you\n\n",
