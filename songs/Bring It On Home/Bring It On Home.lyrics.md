All of my life I've been no damn good
Called every lady in the neighbourhood
But, ooh, baby, I bring it on home to you
Good time girls they don't mean a thing
When I hear that fire bell ring
Ooh baby, I bring it on home to you

Yeah, when I get too mean and down
Gonna turn this big machine around
And, ooh, baby, I bring it on home to you

Balling on the road is a poor man's score
Like a hungry coyote licking at your door
And, ooh, baby, I bring it on home to you

Yeah, when I get too mean and down
Gonna turn this big machine around
And, ooh, baby, I bring it on home to you

Oh, when I get too mean and down
Gonna turn this big machine around
And, ooh, baby, bring it on home to you
