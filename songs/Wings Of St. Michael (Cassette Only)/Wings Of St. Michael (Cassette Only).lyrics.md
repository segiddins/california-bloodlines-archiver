Don't look too far in the far distant stars for the light
There are Angels on horseback who cross the horizon in flight
There is gold in the songs of the voices of dawn
And the voices of dawn they are whispering clear
And the wings of St Michael are here
And the wings of St Michael are here

Cross any water your sons and your daughters have changed
In some other house oh, the Queen of the South holds the reins
There is gold in the songs of the voices of dawn
And the voices of dawn they are whispering clear
And the wings of St Michael are here
And the wings of St Michael are here

There is gold in the songs of the voices of dawn
And the voices of dawn they are whispering clear
And the wings of St Michael are here
And the wings of St Michael are here

Don't look far in the far distant stars for the light
There are Angels on horseback who cross the horizon in flight
There is gold in the songs of the voices of dawn
And the voices of dawn they are whispering clear
And the wings of St Michael are here
And the wings of St Michael are here

And the wings of St Michael are here
And the wings of St Michael are here
