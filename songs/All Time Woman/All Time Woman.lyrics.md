Mother outlaw's been giving me jaw
Saying "why don't you marry the girl?
I know you've been living in sin
Got your backside out to the world"

But an all time woman
Ah, you don't need a preacher to know
That an all time woman
Keeps you ready for the rock and roll
Ready for the rock and roll

Now a one-night stand
For a guitar man
Is easy when the road gets boring
But Holiday Inns and the two dollar gin
Can sure look bad in the morning

Oh, an all time woman
Is the best damn friend I know
Oh, an all time woman
Keeps you ready for the rock and roll
Ready for the rock and roll

Miss America I got your game
It's a Christian burlesque show
Feeding their eyes on your sweet young thighs 
Pretending, yeah, that you don't know

But an all time woman
She ain't selling nothing but soul
Oh, an all time woman
Keeps you ready for the rock and roll
Ready for the rock and roll

An all time woman
With her good love feeding your soul
Oh, an all time woman
Keeps you ready for the rock and roll
Ready for the rock and roll
 
An all time woman
Her good love feeding your soul
Oh, an all time woman
Keeps you ready for the rock and roll
Ready for the rock and roll
