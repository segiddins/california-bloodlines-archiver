    "Lyrics": "Jody stands with his head\nLeaning on the shed\nAs he buttons up his shirt\nLike it was clean\n\nAnd his eye spies the dime\nBy the Doctor Pepper sign\nIt's Jody and the Woman\nAnd the Dream\n\nAnd the wheels that they rode\nThey were gettin' kind of old\nAnd the one-eyed dog  \nWas getting awful mean\n\nBut each sign down the track\nSays there ain't no turnin' back\nNot for Jody, and the Woman\nand the Dream...\n\nOh they''ve been out there sleepin'\nLaughing long and weepin'\nIn the front seat of their pickup\nUntil it's light\n\nAnd the washing of their faces\nIn the honky tonks and places\nLike the rest rooms of  the\nGas stations at night...\n\nBut they know in their hearts\nThat a light shines in the dark\nFor Jody and the Woman\nAnd the Dream...\n\nYeah, they know in their hearts\nThat a light shines in the dark\nFor Jody, and the Woman,\nAnd the Dream.\n\n",
