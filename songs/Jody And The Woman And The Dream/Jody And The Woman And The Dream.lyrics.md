Jody stands with his head
Leaning on the shed
As he buttons up his shirt
Like it was clean

And his eye spies the dime
By the Doctor Pepper sign
It's Jody and the Woman
And the Dream

And the wheels that they rode
They were gettin' kind of old
And the one-eyed dog  
Was getting awful mean

But each sign down the track
Says there ain't no turnin' back
Not for Jody, and the Woman
and the Dream...

Oh they''ve been out there sleepin'
Laughing long and weepin'
In the front seat of their pickup
Until it's light

And the washing of their faces
In the honky tonks and places
Like the rest rooms of  the
Gas stations at night...

But they know in their hearts
That a light shines in the dark
For Jody and the Woman
And the Dream...

Yeah, they know in their hearts
That a light shines in the dark
For Jody, and the Woman,
And the Dream.
