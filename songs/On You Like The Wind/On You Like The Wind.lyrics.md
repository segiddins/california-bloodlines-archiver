Oh, listen to the wind blow
Singing on a crossbow
Can't you feel our love grow
On you like the wind
On you like the wind

Oh, listen to the rain fall
Can't you hear my love call
Can't you feel my heart fall
On you like the wind
On you like the wind
Oh, on you like the wind

Oh, can't you feel it on you
Can't you feel it on you
Can't you feel it on you
On you like the wind
On you like the wind
Oh, on you like the wind

Oh, if you ever leave me
Saying you don't need me
Saying you don't believe in me
I'll be on you like the wind
On you like the wind
Oh, on you like the wind

Oh, can't you feel me on you
Can't you feel me on you
Can't you feel me on you
On you like the wind
On you like the wind
Oh, on you like the wind

Oh, on you like the wind
Oh, on you like the wind
Oh, on you like the wind
Oh, on you like the wind
