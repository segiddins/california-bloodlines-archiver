Julie, Judy, Angel Rain
I'm on the road again
Julie, Judy, Angel Rain
I'm on the road again

Julie was my woman
We never laughed or cried
Julie was my woman
Who never looked inside
Now my woman's Angel Rain
She's the one who drives me sane
And understands when I go chase
Some endless, hopeless train

Julie, Judy, Angel Rain
I'm on the road again
Julie, Judy, Angel Rain
You are the loved ones
Face it friends
I won't find the like
Where the highway ends

Judy was my lover
A flicker in the dark
Judy's songs in the early dawn
Play across my heart
Now my lover's Angel Rain
Who stayed with me
Through all the change
And knows the wind that blows within
Is driving me insane

Julie, Judy, Angel Rain
I'm on the road again
Julie, Judy, Angel Rain
I'm on the road again

Julie, Judy, Angel Rain
I'm on the road again
Julie, Judy, Angel Rain
I'm on the road again
