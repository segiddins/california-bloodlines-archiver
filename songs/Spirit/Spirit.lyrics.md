Spirit my friend
Come on and move me
Spirit my heart lies ready to fly
Above the news of the morning street paper
Spirit my arrow is pulled
And aimed at the sky

Spirit you moved
On the land of my father
Cherokee women lie broken and down
Spirit then on to the land of their brother
Spirit their mother's own blood
Has hallowed the ground

Oh once it was mother
And God and the country
And once it was flags
And the Forth of July
But Spirit the eagle is changing its course
And I know that the horses of war
Finally die

Spirit my friend
Come on and move me
Spirit my heart lies ready to fly
Above the news of the morning street paper
Spirit my arrow is pulled
And aimed at the sky

Oh once it was mother
And God and the country
And once it was flags
And the Forth of July
But Spirit the eagle is changing its course
And I know that the horses of war
Finally die
