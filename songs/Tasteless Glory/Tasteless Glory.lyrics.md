UFO's and grassy knolls, Michael Jackson, channeled souls
Anal Christians afraid of Gays, shameless Poofda's, shades of gray
Divorcing children, K-Mart clothes, aerobic robots, Jackson's nose
MTV, 911, skinheads having skinhead fun
Florence Manchester, Dealey Plaza, timeless trash, molesting fathers
Grooveless rock and pointless stories, Bevis Butthead, tasteless glory
Mad-mans art in artless hands, tuneless songs and heartless bands
Millionaires who still want more, children sleeping on the floor
Houston Astro's, Phoenix Sun's, Brooklyn Dodges, children's guns
Magic malls, acoustic floors, so we all will buy some more
Cindy Crawford, Chevy Chase, Wheel's Of Fortune, Jackson's face
Whoopi Goldberg, studied hip, Cathy Lee and movie clips
Tabloid news to feed the beast, Pope-mobile's and troubled priests
HBO and Cinamax, Bryant Gumble and Peter Max
Heavy Metal, Seattle bands, moshpit boys with screaming glands
Opra Whinfrey, nightmare lives, Gladiators, thunder thighs
Fetal implants, baby Jane, baby steps, a baby's brain, Howard Stern and
acid rain 
Baby boys in Michael's bed, Biafra babies never fed
Rush Limbaugh, ACLU, global warming, me and you
It's Princess time in Culver City, it all comes down to pretty-pretty
Nitty gritty, pretty-pretty
