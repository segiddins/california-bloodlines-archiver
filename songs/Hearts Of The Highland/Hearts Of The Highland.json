    "Lyrics": "She was running 'fore the wind and the wind came around\nAnd they worked by the light of the sun going down\nAnd they know in their heart that the spirits have been born\nFor the hearts of the highland\nFor the hearts of the highland\nFor the hearts of the highland in west Texas on a cold April morn\nIn West Texas on a cold April morn\n\nMolly stirred the flames in the coals of the stone\nAnd they ate from the land and the crops that they had grown\nAnd they dreamed of a place on the banks of Loch Low\nFor the hearts of the highland\nOh the hearts of the highland\nOh the hearts of the highland in west Texas on a cold April morn\nIn West Texas on a cold April morn\nIn West Texas on a cold April morn\n\nOh the heather of the glen was alive in their minds\nAnd the pipes on the wall, they were played every time\nThat the spirit of the wind came singing in the storm\nFor the hearts of the highland\nFor the hearts of the highland\nFor the hearts of the highland in west Texas on a cold April morn\nIn West Texas on a cold April morn\nIn West Texas on a cold April morn\nIn West Texas on a cold April morn\n\n",
