She was running 'fore the wind and the wind came around
And they worked by the light of the sun going down
And they know in their heart that the spirits have been born
For the hearts of the highland
For the hearts of the highland
For the hearts of the highland in west Texas on a cold April morn
In West Texas on a cold April morn

Molly stirred the flames in the coals of the stone
And they ate from the land and the crops that they had grown
And they dreamed of a place on the banks of Loch Low
For the hearts of the highland
Oh the hearts of the highland
Oh the hearts of the highland in west Texas on a cold April morn
In West Texas on a cold April morn
In West Texas on a cold April morn

Oh the heather of the glen was alive in their minds
And the pipes on the wall, they were played every time
That the spirit of the wind came singing in the storm
For the hearts of the highland
For the hearts of the highland
For the hearts of the highland in west Texas on a cold April morn
In West Texas on a cold April morn
In West Texas on a cold April morn
In West Texas on a cold April morn
