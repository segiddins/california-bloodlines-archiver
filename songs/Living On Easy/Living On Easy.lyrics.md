I’ve been living on easy
With a bottle of whiskey
Ain’t got no money
To see my honey

I’ve been living on easy
Oh with a bottle of whiskey
Ain’t got no money
To see my honey

I go see Maggie
She is so porky
She got the personality
To sooth my geniality

I go see Maggie
She is so porky
She got the personality
To sooth my geniality
