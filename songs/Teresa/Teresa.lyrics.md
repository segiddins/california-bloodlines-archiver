Teresa fell without a whimper
Higher artists make no sound
In the Omega Hills of the New Awareness
They made me take The Mother down

They were only pictures of the promise
A higher soul never rests
Who serves the poorest of the poor
She is the best of all the best
She had no place among the drummers
Amidst the stream of eager hearts
I'm just glad it's not the second coming
Paint on canvas was not art

Teresa fell without a whimper
Higher artists make no sound
In the Omega Hills of the New Awareness
They made me take The Mother down
They made me take The Mother down

In the scheme of things, it doesn't matter
Crying children, there's a sound
Hungry people in Culcutta
Would never take The Mother down

Teresa fell without a whimper
Higher artists make no sound
In the Omega Hills of the New Awareness
They made me take The Mother down
They made me take The Mother down

Teresa fell without a whimper
Higher artists make no sound
In the Omega Hills of the New Awareness
They made me take The Mother down
They made me take The Mother down

They made me take The Mother down
They made me take The Mother down
