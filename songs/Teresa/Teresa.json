    "Lyrics": "Teresa fell without a whimper\nHigher artists make no sound\nIn the Omega Hills of the New Awareness\nThey made me take The Mother down\n\nThey were only pictures of the promise\nA higher soul never rests\nWho serves the poorest of the poor\nShe is the best of all the best\nShe had no place among the drummers\nAmidst the stream of eager hearts\nI'm just glad it's not the second coming\nPaint on canvas was not art\n\nTeresa fell without a whimper\nHigher artists make no sound\nIn the Omega Hills of the New Awareness\nThey made me take The Mother down\nThey made me take The Mother down\n\nIn the scheme of things, it doesn't matter\nCrying children, there's a sound\nHungry people in Culcutta\nWould never take The Mother down\n\nTeresa fell without a whimper\nHigher artists make no sound\nIn the Omega Hills of the New Awareness\nThey made me take The Mother down\nThey made me take The Mother down\n\nTeresa fell without a whimper\nHigher artists make no sound\nIn the Omega Hills of the New Awareness\nThey made me take The Mother down\nThey made me take The Mother down\n\nThey made me take The Mother down\nThey made me take The Mother down\n\n",
