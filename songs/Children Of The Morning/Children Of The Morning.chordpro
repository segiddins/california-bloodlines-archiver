 [G][G/F#][G/F]   [C][Am7][Am7/G][D]
 [G][G/F#][G/F]   [C][Am7][Am7/G][D]
 [Em]Dance to the [G]circle, watch it [A]grow,
 [Em]Turning like for[G]ever moving [D]slow,
 For it's [G]on[G/F#])ly a [G]moment, that I [Am7]know,
 [D]Children of the [G]morning told me [D]so.

 [Em]Burn with the [G]fire, make it [A]bright,
 [Em]Catch it on the [G]wind when itÂ´s in [D]flight.
 Oh, it's [G]one [G/F#]lonely [G]flame against the [Am7]night,
 [D]Children of the [G]morning, make it [D]light,
 Make it [G]ooooh.[G/F#][G/F]   [C][Am7][Am7/G][D]
 [G]Ooooh.[G/F#][G/F]   [C][Am7][Am7/G][D]

 [Em]Stand upon the [G]mountain, it is [A]done,
 [Em]Watch them at the [G]crossroads as they [D]come.
 They were [G]blinded [G/F#]by a[G]nother winter's [Am7]sun,
 [D]Children of the [G]morning, you have [D]won.

 [Em]Dance to the [G]circle, watch it [A]grow,
 [Em]Turning like for[G]ever moving [D]slow,
 And it's [G]on[G/F#])ly a [G]moment, that I [Am7]know,
 [D]Children of the [G]morning told me [D]so,
 Children of the [G]morning.[G/F#][G/F]   [C][Am7][Am7/G][D]
 [G]Ooooh....[G/F#][G/F]   [C][Am7][Am7/G][D]
 [G]Ooooh....[G/F#][G/F]   [C][Am7][Am7/G][D](G-'highlight' high notes
 D-C-C-A, downstrum full chord G)
