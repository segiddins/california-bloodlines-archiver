Dance to the circle, watch it grow
Turning like forever moving slow
For it’s only a moment that I know
Children of the morning told me so

Burn with the fire, make it bright
Lost within the spaces out of sight
And it’s one lonely flame against the night
Children of the morning make it light

Warned by a voice upon the breeze
Christened by the waters rolling free
And it’s hidden in the colors of the trees
Children of the morning it is thee

Stand upon the mountain it is done
Watch them at the crossroads as they come
They were blinded by another winter’s sun
Children of the morning you have won

Dance to the circle, watch it grow
Turning like forever moving slow
It’s only a moment that I know
Children of the morning told me so
Children of the morning told me so
Children of the morning, told me so
