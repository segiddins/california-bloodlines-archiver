    "Lyrics": "Dance to the circle, watch it grow\nTurning like forever moving slow\nFor it’s only a moment that I know\nChildren of the morning told me so\n\nBurn with the fire, make it bright\nLost within the spaces out of sight\nAnd it’s one lonely flame against the night\nChildren of the morning make it light\n\nWarned by a voice upon the breeze\nChristened by the waters rolling free\nAnd it’s hidden in the colors of the trees\nChildren of the morning it is thee\n\nStand upon the mountain it is done\nWatch them at the crossroads as they come\nThey were blinded by another winter’s sun\nChildren of the morning you have won\n\nDance to the circle, watch it grow\nTurning like forever moving slow\nIt’s only a moment that I know\nChildren of the morning told me so\nChildren of the morning told me so\nChildren of the morning, told me so\n\n",
