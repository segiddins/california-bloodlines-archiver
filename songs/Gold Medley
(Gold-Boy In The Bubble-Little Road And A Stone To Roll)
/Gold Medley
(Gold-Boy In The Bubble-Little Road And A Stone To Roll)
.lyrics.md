When the lights go down in the California town
People are in for the evening
I jump into my car and I throw in my guitar
My heart's beating time with my breathing
Driving over Kanan, singing to my soul
There's people out there turning music into gold

Oh, my buddy Tim Bass he's working pumping gas
And he makes two fifty for an hour
He's got rhythm in his hands as he's tapping on the cans
Sings rock and roll in the shower
Driving over Kanan, singing to my soul
There's people out there turning music into gold

Oh California girls are the greatest in the world
Each one a song in the making
Singing right to me, I can hear the melody
The story is there for the taking
Driving over Kanan, singing to my soul
There's people out there turning music into gold

There's people out there turning music into gold
There's people out there turning music into gold
There's people out there turning music into gold


It was a slow day
And the sun was beating on the soldiers by the side of the road
There was a bright light
A shattering of shop windows
The bomb in the baby carriage was wired to the radio

These are the days of miracle and wonder
This is the long distance call
The way the camera follows us in slo-mo
The way we look to us all
The way we look to a distant constellation
That’s dying in a corner of the sky
These are the days of miracle and wonder
Don't cry baby, don’t cry, don't cry
 There was a dry wind
And it swept across the desert and it blew into the circle of birth
And the dead sand
Falling on the children
The mothers and the fathers and the automatic earth

These are the days of miracle and wonder
This is the long distance call
The way the camera follows us in slo-mo
The way we look to us all
The way we look to a distant constellation
That’s dying in a corner of the sky
These are the days of miracle and wonder
Don't cry baby, don’t cry, don't cry

It's a turn around jump shot
It's everybody jump start
Every generation throws a hero up the pop charts
Medicine is magical and magical is art
The boy in the bubble and the baby with the baboon heart

And I believe there are lasers in the jungle
Lasers in the jungle somewhere
Staccato signals of constant information
A loose affiliation of millionaire and billionaires and baby

These are the days of miracle and wonder
This is the long distance call
The way the camera follows us in slo-mo
The way we look to us all
The way we look to a distant constellation
That’s dying in a corner of the sky
These are the days of miracle and wonder
Don't cry baby, don’t cry, don't cry


Little road and a stone to roll
Little road and a stone to roll
Little road and a stone to roll
Everybody needs a stone to roll

Everybody needs some old, loose shoes
Everybody needs some new, good news
Everybody needs a sheet to fold
Everybody needs a stone to roll

Little road and a stone to roll
Little road and a stone to roll
Little road and a stone to roll
Everybody needs a stone to roll
Everybody needs a Neil Young tune
Everybody needs a little more room
Everybody needs they're own deep hole
Everybody needs a stone to roll

Little road and a stone to roll
Little road and a stone to roll
Little road and a stone to roll
Everybody needs a stone to roll

Little road and a stone to roll
Little road and a stone to roll
Little road and a stone to roll
Everybody needs a stone to roll
