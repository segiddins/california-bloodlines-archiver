    "Lyrics": "When the lights go down in the California town\nPeople are in for the evening\nI jump into my car and I throw in my guitar\nMy heart's beating time with my breathing\nDriving over Kanan, singing to my soul\nThere's people out there turning music into gold\n\nOh, my buddy Tim Bass he's working pumping gas\nAnd he makes two fifty for an hour\nHe's got rhythm in his hands as he's tapping on the cans\nSings rock and roll in the shower\nDriving over Kanan, singing to my soul\nThere's people out there turning music into gold\n\nOh California girls are the greatest in the world\nEach one a song in the making\nSinging right to me, I can hear the melody\nThe story is there for the taking\nDriving over Kanan, singing to my soul\nThere's people out there turning music into gold\n\nThere's people out there turning music into gold\nThere's people out there turning music into gold\nThere's people out there turning music into gold\n\n\nIt was a slow day\nAnd the sun was beating on the soldiers by the side of the road\nThere was a bright light\nA shattering of shop windows\nThe bomb in the baby carriage was wired to the radio\n\nThese are the days of miracle and wonder\nThis is the long distance call\nThe way the camera follows us in slo-mo\nThe way we look to us all\nThe way we look to a distant constellation\nThat’s dying in a corner of the sky\nThese are the days of miracle and wonder\nDon't cry baby, don’t cry, don't cry\n There was a dry wind\nAnd it swept across the desert and it blew into the circle of birth\nAnd the dead sand\nFalling on the children\nThe mothers and the fathers and the automatic earth\n\nThese are the days of miracle and wonder\nThis is the long distance call\nThe way the camera follows us in slo-mo\nThe way we look to us all\nThe way we look to a distant constellation\nThat’s dying in a corner of the sky\nThese are the days of miracle and wonder\nDon't cry baby, don’t cry, don't cry\n\nIt's a turn around jump shot\nIt's everybody jump start\nEvery generation throws a hero up the pop charts\nMedicine is magical and magical is art\nThe boy in the bubble and the baby with the baboon heart\n\nAnd I believe there are lasers in the jungle\nLasers in the jungle somewhere\nStaccato signals of constant information\nA loose affiliation of millionaire and billionaires and baby\n\nThese are the days of miracle and wonder\nThis is the long distance call\nThe way the camera follows us in slo-mo\nThe way we look to us all\nThe way we look to a distant constellation\nThat’s dying in a corner of the sky\nThese are the days of miracle and wonder\nDon't cry baby, don’t cry, don't cry\n\n\nLittle road and a stone to roll\nLittle road and a stone to roll\nLittle road and a stone to roll\nEverybody needs a stone to roll\n\nEverybody needs some old, loose shoes\nEverybody needs some new, good news\nEverybody needs a sheet to fold\nEverybody needs a stone to roll\n\nLittle road and a stone to roll\nLittle road and a stone to roll\nLittle road and a stone to roll\nEverybody needs a stone to roll\nEverybody needs a Neil Young tune\nEverybody needs a little more room\nEverybody needs they're own deep hole\nEverybody needs a stone to roll\n\nLittle road and a stone to roll\nLittle road and a stone to roll\nLittle road and a stone to roll\nEverybody needs a stone to roll\n\nLittle road and a stone to roll\nLittle road and a stone to roll\nLittle road and a stone to roll\nEverybody needs a stone to roll\n\n",
