It's summer on the Guadeloupe River
Red Wing Boots and Resistal Hats
Taco Bell and the Fountain Motel
46th East and Molly Joe's, Mom and Dad, shaved ice cones
Milkman's truck and satellite dishes, psychic readings look suspicious
Apache Veraday, Anita's Lonestar, linoleum floors
Inner tubes on the Guadeloupe River
And it's one more mile to Slaughter Lane

San Marco's truck stop, upside down at Wonder World
Stars and stripes in the Texas wind, Texas t-shirts, guys named Slim
Road construction, iron cranes, goodwill cars with Pontiac names
Texas Red and lowered cars, university town and Texaco stars
And San Anton
And it's one more mile to Slaughter Lane

Candle shops, sirloin steaks, pancake hops
RV sales, fireworks stands, Austin, Waco and Traveland
Diet Pepsi and Avian
Inside height, nose to rear, dashboard notepads, second gear
And it's one more mile to Slaughter Lane

Ice age carver, Expose
The gentleman's club with the blonde sashay
St. Elmo's rose, Walmart sign, giant frog, used car line
Country songs that I don't know
Easy pawn, rent to own, Budget Inn, TV and phones

It's sundown on the Guadeloupe River
Styrofoam coolers, the new tumbleweed
And it's one more mile to Slaughter Lane
