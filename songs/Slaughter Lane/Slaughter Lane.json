    "Lyrics": "It's summer on the Guadeloupe River\nRed Wing Boots and Resistal Hats\nTaco Bell and the Fountain Motel\n46th East and Molly Joe's, Mom and Dad, shaved ice cones\nMilkman's truck and satellite dishes, psychic readings look suspicious\nApache Veraday, Anita's Lonestar, linoleum floors\nInner tubes on the Guadeloupe River\nAnd it's one more mile to Slaughter Lane\n\nSan Marco's truck stop, upside down at Wonder World\nStars and stripes in the Texas wind, Texas t-shirts, guys named Slim\nRoad construction, iron cranes, goodwill cars with Pontiac names\nTexas Red and lowered cars, university town and Texaco stars\nAnd San Anton\nAnd it's one more mile to Slaughter Lane\n\nCandle shops, sirloin steaks, pancake hops\nRV sales, fireworks stands, Austin, Waco and Traveland\nDiet Pepsi and Avian\nInside height, nose to rear, dashboard notepads, second gear\nAnd it's one more mile to Slaughter Lane\n\nIce age carver, Expose\nThe gentleman's club with the blonde sashay\nSt. Elmo's rose, Walmart sign, giant frog, used car line\nCountry songs that I don't know\nEasy pawn, rent to own, Budget Inn, TV and phones\n\nIt's sundown on the Guadeloupe River\nStyrofoam coolers, the new tumbleweed\nAnd it's one more mile to Slaughter Lane\n\n",
