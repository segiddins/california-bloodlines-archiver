Given any day there's a jet flying somewhere
Oh, she bought a ticket and she vanished in the sky
How was I to know she was leaving in the morning
I never heard her go, she never said goodbye
I've learned to love the night 'cause the light's gonna get ya
Right between the eyes in the morning like a gun
Reaching out your hand and she's not there beside you
Oh, what can I say, lost her in the sun
What have I done?
Lost her in the sun
Lost her in the sun

Oh, lost her in the sun
Oh, lost her in the sun
Lost her in the sun
Oh, I lost her in the sun

Fire up your heart for the wind is getting cold now
It always gets cold for the rider's of the night
You carry that scar when you know what lonesome is
Looking for a home like a bird in flight
And what have I done?
Lost her in the sun
Lost her in the sun

Oh, lost her in the sun
Oh, lost her in the sun
Oh, lost her in the sun
Lost her in the sun
Oh, I lost her in the sun

Oh, lost her in the sun
Oh, lost her in the sun
Oh, lost her in the sun
Oh, lost her in the sun
