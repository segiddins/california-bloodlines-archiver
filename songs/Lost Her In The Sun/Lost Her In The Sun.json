    "Lyrics": "Given any day there's a jet flying somewhere\nOh, she bought a ticket and she vanished in the sky\nHow was I to know she was leaving in the morning\nI never heard her go, she never said goodbye\nI've learned to love the night 'cause the light's gonna get ya\nRight between the eyes in the morning like a gun\nReaching out your hand and she's not there beside you\nOh, what can I say, lost her in the sun\nWhat have I done?\nLost her in the sun\nLost her in the sun\n\nOh, lost her in the sun\nOh, lost her in the sun\nLost her in the sun\nOh, I lost her in the sun\n\nFire up your heart for the wind is getting cold now\nIt always gets cold for the rider's of the night\nYou carry that scar when you know what lonesome is\nLooking for a home like a bird in flight\nAnd what have I done?\nLost her in the sun\nLost her in the sun\n\nOh, lost her in the sun\nOh, lost her in the sun\nOh, lost her in the sun\nLost her in the sun\nOh, I lost her in the sun\n\nOh, lost her in the sun\nOh, lost her in the sun\nOh, lost her in the sun\nOh, lost her in the sun\n\n",
