To be a renegade rising
You sing to the moon
You open your eyes and
You hear a renegade tune
Like the dogs in the morning
They bark at the light
Be a renegade rising
In a renegade night

Cars on the turnpike
Headed for home
Turn off if you like
You're on your own
When nobody sees you
Nobody cares
They'd only be you
If they only dared

To be a renegade rising
You sing to the moon
You open your eyes and
You hear a renegade tune
Like the dogs in the morning
They bark at the light
Be a renegade rising
In a renegade night
Be a renegade rising
In a renegade night

Working so hard at
The company store
Put on your hard hat
And you're sweeping the floor
Out on the blacktop
You're as free as the wind
No reason to stop
You'ld only win

You'ld be a renegade rising
You sing to the moon
You open your eyes and
You hear a renegade tune
Like the dogs in the morning
They bark at the light
Be a renegade rising
In a renegade night
Be a renegade rising
In a renegade night

Oh, the brothers will try
Oh, some others will die
Oh, "If only" applies
Oh, how lonely the skies

If you're a renegade rising
And you sing to the moon
You open your eyes and
You hear a renegade tune
Like the dogs in the morning
They bark at the light
Be a renegade rising
In a renegade night
Be a renegade rising
In a renegade night
Be a renegade rising
In a renegade night
