    "Lyrics": "To be a renegade rising\nYou sing to the moon\nYou open your eyes and\nYou hear a renegade tune\nLike the dogs in the morning\nThey bark at the light\nBe a renegade rising\nIn a renegade night\n\nCars on the turnpike\nHeaded for home\nTurn off if you like\nYou're on your own\nWhen nobody sees you\nNobody cares\nThey'd only be you\nIf they only dared\n\nTo be a renegade rising\nYou sing to the moon\nYou open your eyes and\nYou hear a renegade tune\nLike the dogs in the morning\nThey bark at the light\nBe a renegade rising\nIn a renegade night\nBe a renegade rising\nIn a renegade night\n\nWorking so hard at\nThe company store\nPut on your hard hat\nAnd you're sweeping the floor\nOut on the blacktop\nYou're as free as the wind\nNo reason to stop\nYou'ld only win\n\nYou'ld be a renegade rising\nYou sing to the moon\nYou open your eyes and\nYou hear a renegade tune\nLike the dogs in the morning\nThey bark at the light\nBe a renegade rising\nIn a renegade night\nBe a renegade rising\nIn a renegade night\n\nOh, the brothers will try\nOh, some others will die\nOh, \"If only\" applies\nOh, how lonely the skies\n\nIf you're a renegade rising\nAnd you sing to the moon\nYou open your eyes and\nYou hear a renegade tune\nLike the dogs in the morning\nThey bark at the light\nBe a renegade rising\nIn a renegade night\nBe a renegade rising\nIn a renegade night\nBe a renegade rising\nIn a renegade night\n\n",
