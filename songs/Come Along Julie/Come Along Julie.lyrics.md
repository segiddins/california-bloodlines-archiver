Down through the meadow
I was humming a song
Looking at the stars
As I take my little Julie back home

Watching her eyes
As I tell about the day
The day that's gonna come
When I take my little Julie away

Come along, Julie
Follow the sun
We'll be leavin'
Long before the fall winds come

Listen for a robin
Singing in the trees
Look toward the hills
And be watching, little Julie, for me

Come along, Julie
Follow the sun
We'll be leavin'
Long before the fall winds come
Long before the fall winds come
Long before the fall winds come
