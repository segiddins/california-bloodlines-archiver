    "Lyrics": "Every time I see that Greyhound bus go rolling down the line\nMakes me wish I'd talked much more to you when we had all that time\nStill, it's only wishing and I know it's nothing more\nSo I'm never going back\nNever going back\nNever going back to Nashville anymore\n\nOklahoma City, yes, I know that she won't treat me cruel\nDenver, Colorado, never made me feel like such a fool\nBut these are only cities\nBut they're cities without you\nSo I'm never going back\nNever going back\nNever going back to Nashville anymore\n\nStill, it's only wishing and I know it's nothing more\nSo I'm never going back\nNever going back\nNever going back to Nashville anymore\n\n\nDo you want to dance and hold my hand?\nTell me baby that I'm you man?\nBaby, do you want to dance?\n\nDo you want to dance and make romance?\nThrill me baby all through the night?\nBaby, do you want to dance?\n\nDo you, do you, do you, do you want to dance?\nDo you, do you, do you, do you want to dance?\nDo you, do you, do you, do you want to dance with me?\n\n\nAll the lights and all the towns\nAnd all the wheels turning round\nAnd all the stars, if you count 'em down\nAre less than love, when one heart's found\n\nAnd all the songs that were ever sung\nAnd all the dreams that keep you young\nAnd all the bells that were ever rung\nAre less than love, when one heart's stung\nLess than love, when one heart's stung\n\n\nI'm never going back\nGot a good looking lady out across the track\n\nI'm never going back\nI'm never going back\nI'm never going back no more\n\n",
