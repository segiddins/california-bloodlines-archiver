Every time I see that Greyhound bus go rolling down the line
Makes me wish I'd talked much more to you when we had all that time
Still, it's only wishing and I know it's nothing more
So I'm never going back
Never going back
Never going back to Nashville anymore

Oklahoma City, yes, I know that she won't treat me cruel
Denver, Colorado, never made me feel like such a fool
But these are only cities
But they're cities without you
So I'm never going back
Never going back
Never going back to Nashville anymore

Still, it's only wishing and I know it's nothing more
So I'm never going back
Never going back
Never going back to Nashville anymore


Do you want to dance and hold my hand?
Tell me baby that I'm you man?
Baby, do you want to dance?

Do you want to dance and make romance?
Thrill me baby all through the night?
Baby, do you want to dance?

Do you, do you, do you, do you want to dance?
Do you, do you, do you, do you want to dance?
Do you, do you, do you, do you want to dance with me?


All the lights and all the towns
And all the wheels turning round
And all the stars, if you count 'em down
Are less than love, when one heart's found

And all the songs that were ever sung
And all the dreams that keep you young
And all the bells that were ever rung
Are less than love, when one heart's stung
Less than love, when one heart's stung


I'm never going back
Got a good looking lady out across the track

I'm never going back
I'm never going back
I'm never going back no more
