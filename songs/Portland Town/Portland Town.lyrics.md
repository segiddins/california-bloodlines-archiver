I was born in Portland Town
I was born in Portland Town
Yes I was
Oh, yes I was

October third, I'm on my way
October third, I'm on my way
Yes I am
Oh, yes I am

Rains came the very next day
And I'd be gone so long
There's a gal in Portland Town
And she's singing a marrying song

Going back to Portland Town
Going back to Portland Town
Yes I am
Oh, yes I am

I'll have children one, two, three
I'll have children one, two, three
Yes I will
Oh, yes I will

I was born in Portland Town
