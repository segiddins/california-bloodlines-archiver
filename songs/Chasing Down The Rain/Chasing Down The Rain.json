    "Lyrics": "Where you gonna dance when the boys go home?\nEverybody's tired of the game\nWhere's your second chance with your heart alone?\nAnd your one light chasing down the rain\nAnd your one light chasing down the rain\n\nOne more time, you keep me on the line\nIt's like playing with a razor in the dark\nOne more line, just wasting all my time\nI'm just praying there's a fire in the sparks\nPraying there's a fire in the sparks\n\nWhere you gonna dance when the boys go home?\nEverybody's tired of the game\nWhere's your second chance with your heart alone?\nAnd your one light chasing down the rain\nAnd your one light chasing down the rain\n\nI told you once and I told you twice\nI don't need the heart games anymore\nBut you just won't listen to sound advice\nYou won't find me knocking on your door\nWon't find me knocking on your door\n\nWhere you gonna dance when the boys go home?\nEverybody's tired of the game\nWhere's your second chance with your heart alone?\nAnd your one light chasing down the rain\nAnd your one light chasing down the rain\n\n",
