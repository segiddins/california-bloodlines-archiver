Where you gonna dance when the boys go home?
Everybody's tired of the game
Where's your second chance with your heart alone?
And your one light chasing down the rain
And your one light chasing down the rain

One more time, you keep me on the line
It's like playing with a razor in the dark
One more line, just wasting all my time
I'm just praying there's a fire in the sparks
Praying there's a fire in the sparks

Where you gonna dance when the boys go home?
Everybody's tired of the game
Where's your second chance with your heart alone?
And your one light chasing down the rain
And your one light chasing down the rain

I told you once and I told you twice
I don't need the heart games anymore
But you just won't listen to sound advice
You won't find me knocking on your door
Won't find me knocking on your door

Where you gonna dance when the boys go home?
Everybody's tired of the game
Where's your second chance with your heart alone?
And your one light chasing down the rain
And your one light chasing down the rain
