    "Lyrics": "There's a lonesome, homeward looking bird\nSailing west, without a word\nSailing his shadow, DC highway, coming on\nEverybody watches 'till he's gone\n\nThere's a cold sky breaking where he's been\nFlying westward with the wind\nIt kind of makes me wonder when these empty eyes will find you\nMaybe some tomorrow, my old friend\nMaybe some tomorrow, my old friend\n\nWish I had a poet's open soul\nWish I had a poet's open soul\nFind the songs to tell you, find the words to say\nSoon we will all be going home\nSoon we will all be going home\nSoon we will all be going home\nSoon we will all be going home\n\n",
