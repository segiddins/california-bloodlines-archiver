There's a lonesome, homeward looking bird
Sailing west, without a word
Sailing his shadow, DC highway, coming on
Everybody watches 'till he's gone

There's a cold sky breaking where he's been
Flying westward with the wind
It kind of makes me wonder when these empty eyes will find you
Maybe some tomorrow, my old friend
Maybe some tomorrow, my old friend

Wish I had a poet's open soul
Wish I had a poet's open soul
Find the songs to tell you, find the words to say
Soon we will all be going home
Soon we will all be going home
Soon we will all be going home
Soon we will all be going home
