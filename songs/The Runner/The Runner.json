    "Lyrics": "When your wings no longer catch the wind\nYour wheels are throwing sparks from concrete on the rims\nAnd when you've run so long and you run so hard\nFeeling every stone beneath your feet\nAs they repeat that when you run, you run alone\n\nAnd when your dreams are all just flashbacks\nAnd you're crying beneath the wise cracks\nI've been here before and there is no more\nAnd when you've run so hard and you're worn so thin\nYou find that losing's just another way to win\n\nThen it's time for you to begin\nTo be wings, to be wheels\nAnd to know how it feels\nTo be you on your own\n'Cause when you run\nOh, when you run\nYou run alone\n\nAnd you know you love the game\nLike the river loves the rain\nA sidewinder loves the plain\nSo you can't complain\nNo one hears and no one cares\nThat the road you're going\nDoesn't get you anywhere\nYou're the one who put it there\n\nSo why not go and chase the sun\nThat's one race that just can't be won\nBut at least you have begun\nTo be wings, to be wheels\nAnd to know how it feels\nTo be you on your own\n'Cause when you run\nOh, when you run\nYou run alone\n\n",
