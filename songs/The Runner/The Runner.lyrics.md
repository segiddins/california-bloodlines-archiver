When your wings no longer catch the wind
Your wheels are throwing sparks from concrete on the rims
And when you've run so long and you run so hard
Feeling every stone beneath your feet
As they repeat that when you run, you run alone

And when your dreams are all just flashbacks
And you're crying beneath the wise cracks
I've been here before and there is no more
And when you've run so hard and you're worn so thin
You find that losing's just another way to win

Then it's time for you to begin
To be wings, to be wheels
And to know how it feels
To be you on your own
'Cause when you run
Oh, when you run
You run alone

And you know you love the game
Like the river loves the rain
A sidewinder loves the plain
So you can't complain
No one hears and no one cares
That the road you're going
Doesn't get you anywhere
You're the one who put it there

So why not go and chase the sun
That's one race that just can't be won
But at least you have begun
To be wings, to be wheels
And to know how it feels
To be you on your own
'Cause when you run
Oh, when you run
You run alone
