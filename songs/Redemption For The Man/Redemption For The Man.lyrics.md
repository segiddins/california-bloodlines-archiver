If you were wine I would drink you
If you were bread I would eat you
If you were rain I would bathe in you
If you were air I would breath you
If you were air I would breath you

If you were clay I would mold you
If you were silk I would fold you
If you were cold I would hold you
If you had asked I'd have told you
If you had asked I'd have told you

For you are all I am
Everywhere I stand
You are all I am
Redemption for the man

Were I an actor I'd be you
Were you a cat I would tree you
If you were two I would three you
Were you a bird I would free you
Were you a bird I would free you

Were you a child I'd bear you
Were you a shirt I would wear you
If you were paper I'd tear you
Come closer, I dare you
Come closer, I dare you

For you are all I am
Everywhere I stand
You are all I am
Redemption for the man
Redemption for the man

If you were wine I would drink you
If you were bread I would eat you
If you were rain I would bathe in you
If you were air I would breath you
If you were air I would breath you

Redemption for the man
