I dreamed of all the girls in California
I dreamed of all the girls in the Golden State
And I dreamed about this land where I was born
From Hollywood, up north to the Golden Gate

And I dreamed that if I called you on the phone
That everything would be like it used to be
And I dreamed that you and I had finally learned to fly
From Hollywood, up north
From Hollywood, up north
From Hollywood, up north to the Golden Gate

One more time I won't be with my baby
One more time I just won't be around
For if all the sins of pride were lined up side by side
From Hollywood, up north
They'd go from Hollywood, up north
From Hollywood, up north to the Golden Gate

And I dreamed of all the girls in California
And I dreamed of all the girls in the Golden State
Oh I dreamed about this land where I was born
From Hollywood, up north
From Hollywood, up north
From Hollywood, up north to the Golden Gate

From Hollywood, up north
From Hollywood, up north
From Hollywood, up north to the Golden Gate
