Here we go round again
Singing a song about Molly Dee
Far away I know not where
She's the girl who waits for me

Born one day when the sun did shine
The birds were singing, everyone was fine
Mother and father did agree
We'll call this little girl Molly Dee

Here we go round again
Singing a song about Molly Dee
Far away I know not where
She's the girl who waits for me

Her hair was blonde and her eyes did shine
Her lips were sweet as cherry wine
I'd walk three miles just to be
Sitting with my Molly Dee

Here we go round again
Singing a song about Molly Dee
Far away I know not where
She's the girl who waits for me

The very next day she was gone
Left me here to sing this song
All I do is sit and weep
And dream about my Molly Dee

Here we go round again
Singing a song about Molly Dee
Far away I know not where
She's the girl who waits for me

Here we go round again
Singing a song about Molly Dee
Far away I know not where
She's the girl who waits for me
She's the girl who waits for me
She's the girl who waits for me
