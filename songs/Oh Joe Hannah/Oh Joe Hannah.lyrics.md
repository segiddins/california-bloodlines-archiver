Oh, Joe Hannah don't you go so long
Oh, Joe Hannah don't you go so long
Oh, Joe Hannah don't you go so long
Don't you know the river is wide
Don't you know the mountain is high

Thirteen years I've been working on the river
Thirteen years since you been gone
Thirteen years and you better go home
Don't you know the river is wide
Don't you know the mountain is high

Oh, Joe Hannah don't you go so long
Oh, Joe Hannah don't you go so long
Oh, Joe Hannah don't you go so long
Don't you know the river is wide
Don't you know the mountain is high

Thirteen years I've been working on the river
Thirteen years aint so long
Thirteen years and you better go home
Don't you know the river is wide
Don't you know the mountain is high

Oh, Joe Hannah don't you go so long
Oh, Joe Hannah don't you go so long
Oh, Joe Hannah don't you go so long
Don't you know the river is wide
Don't you know the mountain is high

Thirteen years I've been working on the river
Thirteen years I've been alone
Thirteen years and you better go home
Don't you know the river is wide
Don't you know the mountain is high

Oh, Joe Hannah
