    "Lyrics": "Black boy in Chicago\nPlaying in the street\nNot enough to wear\nNot near enough to eat\nBut don't you know he saw it\nOn a July afternoon\nHe saw a man named Armstrong\nWalk upon the moon\n\nYoung girl in Calcutta\nBarely eight years old\nThe flies that swarm the market place\nWill see she don't get old\nBut don't you know she heard it\nOn that July afternoon\nShe heard a man named Armstrong\nHad walked upon the moon\nShe heard a man named Armstrong\nHad walked upon the moon\n\nThe rivers are getting' dirty\nThe wind is getting bad\nWar and hate is killing off\nThe only earth we have\nBut the world all stopped to watch it\nOn that July afternoon\nTo watch a man named Armstrong\nWalk upon the moon\nTo watch a man named Armstrong\nWalk upon the moon\n\nOh I wonder if a long time ago\nSomewhere in the universe\nThey watched a man named Adam\nWalk upon the earth\n\n",
