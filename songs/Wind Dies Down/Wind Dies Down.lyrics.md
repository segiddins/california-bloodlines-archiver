How is your river flowin' this week
It's as dry as a scar
On a cowboy's cheek
Where is the girl that you're trying to reach
She's as high as a snake
In an eagle's beak

Moonlight Albright ran away
With a drifter come yesterday
Moonlight, she didn't know his name
He must have come on
Like a gospel train

Circle the sun
And we all go around
It's gonna be a lot better
When the wind dies down
Circle the sun
And we all go around
It's gonna be a lot better
When the wind dies down

Moonlight, all right
I shed a few tears
Went to bed alone
Like I done for years
Moonlight's note said, "Here I go
Leavin' the world of Ohio"

Circle the sun
And we all go around
It's gonna be a lot better
When the wind dies down

Circle the sun
And we all go around
It's gonna be a lot better
When the wind dies down
