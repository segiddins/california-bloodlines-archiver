Is the weather any better
Any further down the road
Jimmy Wheeler would have been here but he died
And I gave my only sweater
To a girl that I didn't know
Cause I showed her Jimmy's letter and she cried

Rivers of light
Down the road in the night
Why don't you wake up Mary so she can see
Rivers of light
Down the road in the night
Why don't you wake up Mary so she can see

There's a face behind the blind
Don't you pay it any mind
Cause they don't take to strangers passing by
Someone robbed the dry goods store
In '39 before the war
And they don't think it's safe out after five

Rivers of light
Down the road in the night
Why don't you wake up Mary so she can see
Rivers of light
Down the road in the night
Why don't you wake up Mary so she can see

Is the weather any better
Any further down the road
Jimmy Wheeler would have been here but he died
And I gave my only sweater
To a girl that I didn't know
Cause I showed her Jimmy's letter and she cried

Rivers of light
Down the road in the night
Why don't you wake up Mary so she can see
Rivers of light
Down the road in the night
Why don't you wake up Mary

Rivers of light
Down the road in the night
Why don't you wake up Mary so she can see
Rivers of light
Down the road in the night
Why don't you wake up Mary so she can see
so she can see
so she can see
