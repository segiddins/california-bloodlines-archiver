    "Lyrics": "Is the weather any better\nAny further down the road\nJimmy Wheeler would have been here but he died\nAnd I gave my only sweater\nTo a girl that I didn't know\nCause I showed her Jimmy's letter and she cried\n\nRivers of light\nDown the road in the night\nWhy don't you wake up Mary so she can see\nRivers of light\nDown the road in the night\nWhy don't you wake up Mary so she can see\n\nThere's a face behind the blind\nDon't you pay it any mind\nCause they don't take to strangers passing by\nSomeone robbed the dry goods store\nIn '39 before the war\nAnd they don't think it's safe out after five\n\nRivers of light\nDown the road in the night\nWhy don't you wake up Mary so she can see\nRivers of light\nDown the road in the night\nWhy don't you wake up Mary so she can see\n\nIs the weather any better\nAny further down the road\nJimmy Wheeler would have been here but he died\nAnd I gave my only sweater\nTo a girl that I didn't know\nCause I showed her Jimmy's letter and she cried\n\nRivers of light\nDown the road in the night\nWhy don't you wake up Mary so she can see\nRivers of light\nDown the road in the night\nWhy don't you wake up Mary\n\nRivers of light\nDown the road in the night\nWhy don't you wake up Mary so she can see\nRivers of light\nDown the road in the night\nWhy don't you wake up Mary so she can see\nso she can see\nso she can see\n\n",
