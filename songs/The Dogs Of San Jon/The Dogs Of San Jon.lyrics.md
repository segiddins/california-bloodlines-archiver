Have you seen Elijah? He is part coyote 
That’s what the young albino said 
Have you seen Elijah? Hear he eats peyote 
Throwing back a young albino head 
Before they closed the highway, 
We had flamingos on the lawn 
Drivers said to fill her up, 
And we’d be movin’ on 
Before they closed the highway, 
We had flamingos on the lawn 

Chorus:
The Old Ones are vanishing, 
And soon they will be gone 
And all that we’ll be hearing, 
All that we’ll be hearing 
All that we’ll be hearing,
Is the barking of the Dogs of San Jon 

Was you ever in Texas, 
Yeah when the locusts were flying 
Was you ever in Texas, 
Yeah when the highways were alive 
Well I have been in Texas 
When the locusts were flying 
Yeah I’ve been in Texas 
When they blackened the skies 

There are ghosts that should be sleeping 
I hear them on the ground 
Kicking at the oil can 
Making ghostly sounds 
There are ghosts that should be sleeping 
I can hear them on the ground 

(Repeat Chorus)

In Amarillo juke joints 
Oh they dance the night away 
The dogs are chained and barking 
Every hour of the day 
In Amarillo juke joints yeah 
Yeah they dance the night away 
Yeah they dance the night away 

(Repeat Chorus)
