    "Lyrics": "Have you seen Elijah? He is part coyote \nThat’s what the young albino said \nHave you seen Elijah? Hear he eats peyote \nThrowing back a young albino head \nBefore they closed the highway, \nWe had flamingos on the lawn \nDrivers said to fill her up, \nAnd we’d be movin’ on \nBefore they closed the highway, \nWe had flamingos on the lawn \n\nChorus:\nThe Old Ones are vanishing, \nAnd soon they will be gone \nAnd all that we’ll be hearing, \nAll that we’ll be hearing \nAll that we’ll be hearing,\nIs the barking of the Dogs of San Jon \n\nWas you ever in Texas, \nYeah when the locusts were flying \nWas you ever in Texas, \nYeah when the highways were alive \nWell I have been in Texas \nWhen the locusts were flying \nYeah I’ve been in Texas \nWhen they blackened the skies \n\nThere are ghosts that should be sleeping \nI hear them on the ground \nKicking at the oil can \nMaking ghostly sounds \nThere are ghosts that should be sleeping \nI can hear them on the ground \n\n(Repeat Chorus)\n\nIn Amarillo juke joints \nOh they dance the night away \nThe dogs are chained and barking \nEvery hour of the day \nIn Amarillo juke joints yeah \nYeah they dance the night away \nYeah they dance the night away \n\n(Repeat Chorus)\n\n",
