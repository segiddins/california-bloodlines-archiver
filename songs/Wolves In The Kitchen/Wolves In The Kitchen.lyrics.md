Gotta wake up the child
There's wolves in the kitchen
Coming in the back door
Sneaking in the hall
Oh, wake up the child
There's wolves in the kitchen
Tell her "better run now"
'Cause she can't get 'em all

Pretty little girl
Standing on the bus stop
Sticking out her young thumb
As the cars go by
Oh, pretty little girl
Better keep your legs crossed
'Cause I'd hate to see you get lost
On a long, long ride

Gotta wake up the child
There's wolves in the kitchen
Coming in the back door
Sneaking in the hall
Oh, wake up the child
There's wolves in the kitchen
Tell her "better run now"
'Cause she can't get 'em all

Just look at all the warlords
And they're talking on the TV
Selling us blue sky 
That we're never gonna see
Forget all the ransom
I think we ought to pants 'em
And put 'em on a lead boat
In the Salt Lake Sea

Gotta wake up the child
There's wolves in the kitchen
Coming in the back door
Sneaking in the hall
 
Oh, wake up the child
There's wolves in the kitchen
Tell her "better run now"
'Cause she can't get 'em all

Gotta wake up the child
There's wolves in the kitchen
Coming in the back door
Sneaking in the hall
Oh, wake up the child
There's wolves in the kitchen
Tell her "better run now"
'Cause she can't get 'em all
