Found her out on the cane-break road
Blankets she had rolled
She was all of five foot-five
Sixteen years of old
Oh the rain can sure blow thunder
When you steal the devil's kin
She said "Lay me by cool water
There's fire in the wind"

I told her she could stay with me
Wash and mend my cloths
I would feed and keep her here
Until she chose to go
Oh the rain can sure blow thunder
When you steal the devil's kin
She said "Lay me by cool water
There's fire in the wind"

Travellers seldom came our way
We lived across the plain
I called the girl Susanna
For I never knew her name
Oh the rain can sure blow thunder
When you steal the devil's kin
She said "Lay me by cool water
There's fire in the wind
Oh lay me by cool water
There's fire in the wind"

Her dress was long, too small for her
And tight as midnight light
She'd lay her head upon my chest
And hold me through the night
Oh the rain can sure blow thunder
When you steal the devil's kin
So I laid her by cool water
She was fire in the wind
Oh I laid her by cool water
She was fire in the wind
Oh I laid her by cool water
She was fire in the wind
