Her (Am)dress was long, too (Em)small for her,
And (Am)tight as midnight (Em)light.

And (Am)hold me through the (Em)night.

Oh, the (C)rain can sure blow (F)thunder
When you (G)steal the devil's (Em)kin.
So I (Am)laid her by cool (Em)water,
She was (F)fire in the (Fj7)wind.
Oh, I (Am)laid her by cool (Em)water,
