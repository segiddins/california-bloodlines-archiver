She sounds like birds, flying in the moonlight
She feels like fog, covering your eyes
She looks like gold, oh but don't you believe her
Beat the lady of fame at the lady's own game

She's a blinding light, for the heros of the homeless
A one way flight, for believers in the dream
She's an endless night, for those who bought the starlight
Beat the lady of fame at the lady's own game
Beat the lady of fame at the lady's own game

If you can laugh, in the face of the fire
If you can dance, in the light of the flames
And if you don't look down, when you're up on the wire
You'll beat the lady of fame at the lady's own game
You'll beat the lady of fame at the lady's own game

If you can laugh, in the face of the fire
If you can dance, in the light of the flames
And if you don't look down, when you're up on the wire
You'll beat the lady of fame at the lady's own game
You'll beat the lady of fame at the lady's own game
