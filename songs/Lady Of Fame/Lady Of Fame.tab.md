Continue into first verse...

She sounds like birds, flying in the moonlight
She feels like (Gm)fog, covering your (A7/4 short)eyes. (A7 short)
She looks like (Dm)gold, oh but don't you (Gm)believe her,
Beat the lady of (Bb)fame (C) at the lady's own (Dm)game.
(Bb) (C) (Dm) {picking up (Dm) (Dsus2) strumming pattern}

She's a blinding light for the heroes of the homeless,
A one way (Gm)flight for believers in the (A7/4 short)dream. (A7 short)
She's an endless (Dm)night for those who bought the (Gm)starlight,
Beat the lady of (Bb)fame (Am) at the lady's own (Dm)game,
Beat the lady of (Bb)fame (Am) at the lady's own (Dm)game. (hold)

If you can (Bb)laugh (C) in the face of the (F)fire,
If you can (Dm)dance (C) in the light of the (Am)flames,
And if you don't look (Dm)down (Bb) when you're (C)up on the (F)wire,
You'll beat the lady of (Bb)fame (Am) at the lady's own (Dm)game,
You'll beat the lady of (Bb)fame (Am) at the lady's own (Dm)game.
(Bb) (Am) (Dm)  (Bb) (Am) (Dm)  (Bb) (Am) (Dm)  (Bb) (C) (Dm) (hold)

If you can (Bb)laugh (C) in the face of the (F)fire,
If you can (Dm)dance, (C) oh, in the light of the (Am)flames,
And if you don't look (Dm)down (Bb) when you're (C)up on the (F)wire,
You'll beat the lady of (Bb)fame (Am) at the lady's own (Dm)game,
You'll beat the lady of (Bb)fame (Am) at the lady's own (Dm)game.

If you can (Bb)laugh (C) in the face of the (F)fire,
If you can (Dm)dance, (C) oh, in the light of the (Am)flames,
And if you don't look (Dm)down (Bb) when you're (C)up on the (F)wire,
You'll beat the lady of (Bb)fame (Am) at the lady's own (Dm)game,
You'll beat the lady of (Bb)fame (Am) at the lady's own (Dm)game.
(Bb) (Am) (Dm)  (Bb) (Am) (Dm)  (Bb) (Am) (Dm)  (Bb) (C) (Dm) and fade out
