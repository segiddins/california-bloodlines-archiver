    "Lyrics": "She sounds like birds, flying in the moonlight\nShe feels like fog, covering your eyes\nShe looks like gold, oh but don't you believe her\nBeat the lady of fame at the lady's own game\n\nShe's a blinding light, for the heros of the homeless\nA one way flight, for believers in the dream\nShe's an endless night, for those who bought the starlight\nBeat the lady of fame at the lady's own game\nBeat the lady of fame at the lady's own game\n\nIf you can laugh, in the face of the fire\nIf you can dance, in the light of the flames\nAnd if you don't look down, when you're up on the wire\nYou'll beat the lady of fame at the lady's own game\nYou'll beat the lady of fame at the lady's own game\n\nIf you can laugh, in the face of the fire\nIf you can dance, in the light of the flames\nAnd if you don't look down, when you're up on the wire\nYou'll beat the lady of fame at the lady's own game\nYou'll beat the lady of fame at the lady's own game\n\n",
