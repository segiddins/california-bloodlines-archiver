    "Lyrics": "I remember America \nI remember it well\nWhen you could walk downtown in the middle of the night\nWithout the smell of fear on your shoulder\nAs you jump at every sound\nAnd you never look in the eye of any stranger\nWho could easily gun you down\nI remember America\nI remember every town\nWhen crack was the sound that caps would make\nIn the only guns that kids would have around\n\nI remember America\nI remember my friends\nI remember America\nAnd I want to be safe again\n\nI remember America\nI remember the time\nWhen Rock N' Roll was cool and fun and we'd read between the lines\nI remember America\nLike you remember the dead\nWhen freedom of speech wasn't every four-letter word a sailor never said\nI remember America\nAnd I remember my schools\nNow it's graft and gangs and guards and guns and needles in the pool\n I remember America\nWhen kids could walk alone\nGo to the corner for a root beer float and safely make it home\n\nI remember America\nI remember my friends\nI remember America\nAnd I want to be safe again\n\nI remember America\nI remember my home\nThat any working man would proudly say it was something that he owned\nI remember America\nAnd I remember the day\nNovember twenty second, nineteen sixty three, \nWhen they blew the dreams away\nI remember America\nI remember my friends\nI remember America\nAnd I want to be safe again\n\nI remember America\nI remember America\nI remember America\n\n",
