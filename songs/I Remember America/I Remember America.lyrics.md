I remember America 
I remember it well
When you could walk downtown in the middle of the night
Without the smell of fear on your shoulder
As you jump at every sound
And you never look in the eye of any stranger
Who could easily gun you down
I remember America
I remember every town
When crack was the sound that caps would make
In the only guns that kids would have around

I remember America
I remember my friends
I remember America
And I want to be safe again

I remember America
I remember the time
When Rock N' Roll was cool and fun and we'd read between the lines
I remember America
Like you remember the dead
When freedom of speech wasn't every four-letter word a sailor never said
I remember America
And I remember my schools
Now it's graft and gangs and guards and guns and needles in the pool
 I remember America
When kids could walk alone
Go to the corner for a root beer float and safely make it home

I remember America
I remember my friends
I remember America
And I want to be safe again

I remember America
I remember my home
That any working man would proudly say it was something that he owned
I remember America
And I remember the day
November twenty second, nineteen sixty three, 
When they blew the dreams away
I remember America
I remember my friends
I remember America
And I want to be safe again

I remember America
I remember America
I remember America
