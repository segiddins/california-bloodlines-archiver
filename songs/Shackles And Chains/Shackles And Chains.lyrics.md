Barstow, on to L.A.
Set my soul a-saying 
C'mon you old railroad
You ain't got a shackle or a chain
You ain't got a shackle or a chain

Goodbye country woman
Driving me insane
Hello anybody
If you ain't got a shackle or a chain
If you ain't got a shackle or a chain

Let me go, let me ramble
I don't want to know the pain
Of the rattle and the clatter
Of the shackles and the chains
Let me go, let me ramble
I don't want to know the pain
Of the rattle and the clatter
Of the shackles and the chains
