Capo 3rd fret
 
  Intro :(D)
 
  Barstow, on to L.A.,
  Set my soul a-saying,
  "C'mon you old railroad, (D7)
  (G)You ain't got a (F#m)shackle (Em)or a (D)chain,
  (G)You ain't got a (F#m)shackle (Em)or a (D)chain."
 
  Goodbye, country woman,
  Driving me insane.
  Hello, anybody,
  If (G)you ain't got a (F#m)shackle (Em)or a (D)chain,
  If (G)you ain't got a (F#m)shackle (Em)or a (D)chain. (D7)
 
  Let me (G)go, let me (C)ramble,
  I don't (G)want to know the (C)pain
  Of the (G)rattle and the (Em)clatter
  Of the (C)shackles and the (G)chains.
  Let me go, let me (C)ramble,
  I don't (G)want to know the (C)pain
  Of the (G)rattle and the (Em)clatter
  Of the (C)shackles and the (G)chains. (A7) (D)
