Looking back Joanna
When you really loved me
When the sun in the morning
Come without a warning on my door
Looking back Joanna
How it all just ended on the floor

Looking back Joanna
When you were but a child
Even when you smiled you would cry
Looking back Joanna
Every time I touched you, I would lie

There is a river
Running changes by me
There is a river
That takes me to the sea
There is a river
It has made me free

Looking back Joanna
To that summer in Savannah
And I would find you lying in my bed
Looking back Joanna
I still can hear you breathing in my head

There is a river
Running changes by me
There is a river
That takes me to the sea
There is a river
It has made me free

Looking back Joanna
When you really loved me
When the sun in the morning
Come without a warning on my door
Looking back Joanna
How it all just ended on the floor
On the floor

Looking back Joanna
Looking back Joanna
Looking back Joanna
