Theirs are the faces that shine in the crowd
They're the chosen
Theirs are the voices who whisper out loud
They're the chosen
Theirs are the eyes that are burning inside
Like we're frozen

Theirs are the faces that shine in the crowd
They're the chosen
Theirs are the dreams that were born in the light
They're the chosen
Theirs are the Angels guarding the night
They're the chosen
Theirs are the eyes that are burning inside
Like we're frozen

Theirs are the faces that shine in the crowd
They're the chosen

Theirs are the eyes that are burning inside
Like we're frozen

Theirs are the faces that shine in the crowd
They're the chosen
They're the chosen
They're the chosen
They're the chosen
