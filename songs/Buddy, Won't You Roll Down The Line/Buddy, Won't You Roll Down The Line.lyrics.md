Buddy won’t you roll down the line
Buddy won’t you roll down the line
Yonder comes my darling
Coming down the line
Buddy won’t you roll down the line
Buddy won’t you roll down the line
Yonder comes my darling
Coming down the line

Judy got a gun
She was living on the run
And there was Rose
Now she's down town out of time 
Judy’s found a man
He was the leader of a band
And he took the Rose, oh
Buddy better roll on down the line

Buddy won’t you roll down the line
Buddy won’t you roll down the line
Yonder comes my darling
Coming down the line
Buddy won’t you roll down the line
Buddy won’t you roll down the line
Yonder comes my darling
Coming down the line

One more time around
And it's time to leave this town
Down to Mexico
You know it's hanging right behind
One more man to trash
Just more cheque to cash 
That's all you know, oh
Buddy better get on down the line

Buddy won’t you roll down the line
Buddy won’t you roll down the line
Yonder comes my darling
Coming down the line
 
Buddy won’t you roll down the line
Buddy won’t you roll down the line
Yonder comes my darling
Coming down the line

Oh you never had a plan
It fell right in your hand
And it turned to stone
Playing down the silver line
Now all the money's gone
And the man who wrote the song
Said pack and go, oh
Buddy better roll on down the line

Buddy won’t you roll down the line
Buddy won’t you roll down the line
Yonder comes my darling
Coming down the line
Buddy won’t you roll down the line
Buddy won’t you roll down the line
Yonder comes my darling
Coming down the line
