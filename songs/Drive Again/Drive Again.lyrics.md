Oh sweet traveller
Head on my shoulder
Gonna do that drive again
I got to have her
Every dream I sold her, oh
Gonna do that drive again

Gonna do that drive again
Do that drive again
Gonna do that drive again
I'm gonna do that drive again
Do that drive again
Gonna do that drive again

Hard luck and trouble
Follow where I been
Gonna do that drive again
In the corn field stubble
I shall plant the seeds again
Gonna do that drive again

I'm gonna do that drive again
Do that drive again
Gonna do that drive again
I'm gonna do that drive again
Do that drive again
Gonna do that drive again

Shotgun rider
Stay right by me friend
Gonna do that drive again
Sweet white spider
Bite me every now and then
Gonna do that drive again

I'm gonna do that drive again
Do that drive again
Gonna do that drive again
I'm gonna do that drive again
Do that drive again
Gonna do that drive again
