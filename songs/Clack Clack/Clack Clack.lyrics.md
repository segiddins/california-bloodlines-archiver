Clack, clack, clack
As the train is a-rolling down the track
To carry me home
Back where I belong
Clack, clack, clack
As the train is a-rolling down the track
To carry me home
Back where I belong

Dakota sky
Made us feel like a river
Running free, running free
And when I die
Bring the wheels that deliver
Restless me, restless me

Let me hear the clack, clack, clack
As the train goes rolling down the track
To carry me home
Back where I belong
Clack, clack, clack
As the train goes rolling down the track
To carry me home
Back where I belong

It was Bobby's song
That I wrote without trying
Every word, every word
Now that Bobby's gone
This is my way of crying
When I heard, when I heard

Listen to the clack, clack, clack
As the train goes rolling down the track
To carry him home
Back to where he belongs
Clack, clack, clack
As the train goes rolling down the track
To carry me home
Back where I belong
