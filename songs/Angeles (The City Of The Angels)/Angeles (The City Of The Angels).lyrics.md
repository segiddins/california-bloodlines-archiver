She came from Kansas City on a one way ticket bus
The family at the depot saying "You can count on us"
"See you in the movies, up on the silver screen
'Cause nothing can go wrong for the Kansas City Queen"

And the Greyhound has hit the highway; it's out on the midnight run
Wheels are singing "You're on your way, your life has just begun"
Taking out a clip from the Kansas City Sun
Where she had the lead in Annie Get Your Gun

Angeles, oh, in Angeles
They all come and no one leaves
In Angeles, oh in Angeles
The city of the Angels, yeah
City of the Angels
City of the Angels
Yeah, there's nothing to believe

She had only been in town for a day or maybe three
Met someone who said he'd take some pictures of her free
And he said "My name is Louie, I make movies on my own
I know Dustin Hoffman, he just called me on the phone"

Angeles, oh, in Angeles
They all come and no one leaves
In Angeles, oh in Angeles
The city of the Angels, yeah
City of the Angels
City of the Angels
Yeah, there's nothing to believe

She was slinging cocktails in the valley for a while
She's got the desperations, lost her Kansas City smile
She can't go back to Kansas with a heart of broken dreams
So she'll just keep on dreaming, that Kansas City queen

Angeles, oh, in Angeles
They all come and no one leaves
In Angeles, oh in Angeles
The city of the Angels, yeah
City of the Angels
City of the Angels
