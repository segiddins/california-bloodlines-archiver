    "Lyrics": "She came from Kansas City on a one way ticket bus\nThe family at the depot saying \"You can count on us\"\n\"See you in the movies, up on the silver screen\n'Cause nothing can go wrong for the Kansas City Queen\"\n\nAnd the Greyhound has hit the highway; it's out on the midnight run\nWheels are singing \"You're on your way, your life has just begun\"\nTaking out a clip from the Kansas City Sun\nWhere she had the lead in Annie Get Your Gun\n\nAngeles, oh, in Angeles\nThey all come and no one leaves\nIn Angeles, oh in Angeles\nThe city of the Angels, yeah\nCity of the Angels\nCity of the Angels\nYeah, there's nothing to believe\n\nShe had only been in town for a day or maybe three\nMet someone who said he'd take some pictures of her free\nAnd he said \"My name is Louie, I make movies on my own\nI know Dustin Hoffman, he just called me on the phone\"\n\nAngeles, oh, in Angeles\nThey all come and no one leaves\nIn Angeles, oh in Angeles\nThe city of the Angels, yeah\nCity of the Angels\nCity of the Angels\nYeah, there's nothing to believe\n\nShe was slinging cocktails in the valley for a while\nShe's got the desperations, lost her Kansas City smile\nShe can't go back to Kansas with a heart of broken dreams\nSo she'll just keep on dreaming, that Kansas City queen\n\nAngeles, oh, in Angeles\nThey all come and no one leaves\nIn Angeles, oh in Angeles\nThe city of the Angels, yeah\nCity of the Angels\nCity of the Angels\n\n",
