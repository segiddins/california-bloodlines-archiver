I will never forget Aunt Delores
In the dusty white linen she sat
Or the dozen white lilies and ribbons
Carefully held in her lap
And she smiled serenely at no one
As her memories faded away
You see she is having a party
It's her ninety first birthday today

See the hearse stalled out there on the highway
Some neighborhood boys looked inside
The long metal box was so shiny
They wonder who's taking the ride
And Henry has found a brown lizard
Sunning itself on the ground
And the hearse pulls away quite unnoticed
As they're passing the lizard around

One tiny grain of sand
Cast against the sky
A million stars around it
To see that it can fly
And around the stars, the heavens
And all that lies beyond
All around this grain of sand
We are standing on

And if you turn off on Glen Annie Road
And a pretty young girl comes your way
It's just Elaine out chasing the morning
It's her favorite time of day

One tiny grain of sand
Cast against the sky
A million stars around it
To see that it can fly
And around the stars, the heavens
And all that lies beyond
All around this grain of sand
We are standing on

And around the stars, the heavens
And all that lies beyond
All around this grain of sand
We are standing on
