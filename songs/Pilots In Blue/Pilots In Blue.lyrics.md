Here in the sight of a long dark night
Driving and thinking of you
There was something unknown on that long dark road
The spirit of being alone
Shooting the moon, on to Mars
In a sky that holds nothing but stars
Pilots in blue, searching for you
Pilots in blue, searching for you

How could I know that the light in the road
Was just at the end of the trees?
Was it the night or the windshield light
Or feeling like making believe?
I was shooting the moon, on to Mars
In a sky that holds nothing but stars
Pilots in blue, searching for you
Pilots in blue, searching for you

Here in the sight of a long dark night
Driving and thinking of you
There was something unknown on that long dark road
The spirit of being alone
Shooting the moon, on to Mars
In a sky that holds nothing but stars
Pilots in blue, searching for you
Pilots in blue, searching for you

Pilots in blue, searching for you
Pilots in blue, searching for you
