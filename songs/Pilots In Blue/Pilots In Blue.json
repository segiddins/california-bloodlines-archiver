    "Lyrics": "Here in the sight of a long dark night\nDriving and thinking of you\nThere was something unknown on that long dark road\nThe spirit of being alone\nShooting the moon, on to Mars\nIn a sky that holds nothing but stars\nPilots in blue, searching for you\nPilots in blue, searching for you\n\nHow could I know that the light in the road\nWas just at the end of the trees?\nWas it the night or the windshield light\nOr feeling like making believe?\nI was shooting the moon, on to Mars\nIn a sky that holds nothing but stars\nPilots in blue, searching for you\nPilots in blue, searching for you\n\nHere in the sight of a long dark night\nDriving and thinking of you\nThere was something unknown on that long dark road\nThe spirit of being alone\nShooting the moon, on to Mars\nIn a sky that holds nothing but stars\nPilots in blue, searching for you\nPilots in blue, searching for you\n\nPilots in blue, searching for you\nPilots in blue, searching for you\n\n",
