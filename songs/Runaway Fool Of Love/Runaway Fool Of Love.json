    "Lyrics": "California boy, learning how to live on the road\nI found me a woman who got down to my soul\nAnd I never knew what I had 'till I lost you\nI swear to the stars above\nAnd you can call me a runaway fool of love\n\nI treated you bad I was walking with my head in the clouds\nNow I'm feeling so lonely living my life in a crowd\nOh, I never knew what I had 'till I lost you\nI swear to the stars above\nAnd you can call me a runaway fool of love\n\nAnd you can move me\nAnd you can hold me\nAnd roll me like a glove\nOh, you can call me\nA runaway fool of love\n\nOh, I never knew what I had 'till I lost you\nI swear to the stars above\nAnd you can call me a runaway fool of love\n\nAnd you can move me\nAnd you can hold me\nAnd roll me like a glove\nOh, you can call me\nA runaway fool of love\n\nOh, you can call me\nA runaway fool of love\n\n",
