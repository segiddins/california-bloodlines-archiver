California boy, learning how to live on the road
I found me a woman who got down to my soul
And I never knew what I had 'till I lost you
I swear to the stars above
And you can call me a runaway fool of love

I treated you bad I was walking with my head in the clouds
Now I'm feeling so lonely living my life in a crowd
Oh, I never knew what I had 'till I lost you
I swear to the stars above
And you can call me a runaway fool of love

And you can move me
And you can hold me
And roll me like a glove
Oh, you can call me
A runaway fool of love

Oh, I never knew what I had 'till I lost you
I swear to the stars above
And you can call me a runaway fool of love

And you can move me
And you can hold me
And roll me like a glove
Oh, you can call me
A runaway fool of love

Oh, you can call me
A runaway fool of love
