Oh wind upon the window
There’s a sign upon the door
I’m going home
I’m finally going home
Oh will you love me like before
When I was in Baltimore?
An Angel on the road shoulder
Knows the way home

As I write to you this letter
There’s just one thing I can say
I’m going home
I’m finally going home
Oh you can be the window yeah
Or you can be the door
An Angel on the road shoulder
A light upon the shore

An Angel on the road shoulder
Knows the way home
Clicking off the miles yeah
That I have been before
Oh you can be the window yeah
Or you can be the door
An Angel on the road shoulder
A light upon the shore

Oh wind upon the window
There’s a sign upon the door
I’m going home
I’m finally going home
Oh will you love me like before
When I was in Baltimore?
An Angel on the road shoulder
A light upon the shore
 An Angel on the road shoulder
Knows the way home
Clicking off the miles yeah
That I have been before
Oh you can be the window yeah
Or you can be the door
An Angel on the road shoulder
A light upon the shore

An Angel on the road shoulder
Knows the way home
