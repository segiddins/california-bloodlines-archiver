Is it true that we are living
In the last days of the world?
And often I have wondered
Will you always be my girl?
Will you be my girl?
And we'll dance the night away
And we'll remember Elvis
And we'll dream of better days
Dream of better days
As we listen to the sound 
And we chew upon the lessons
We won't always be around 
And you hear the sound
It's "Will you always be my girl 
And we can dance together
In the midnight of the world?"

Of the world, yeah
In the midnight of the world
Of the world, yeah
In the midnight of the world

How long have we been talking
About the poison in the rain?
And the faceless corporations
Who really are to blame
Are they to blame
That we don't get along?
So let's turn on the T.V
And pretend that nothings wrong
It's like a song
That you must always be my girl 
And we can dance together
In the midnight of the world

Of the world, yeah
In the midnight of the world
Of the world, yeah
In the midnight of the world
Of the world, take care
It's the midnight of the world

This white man got the message
From everyone we've screwed
From the women, blacks and Indians
It was on the evening news
On the evening news
They had pictures at the scene
And I wonder who among them
Could say their skirts are clean?
But what I mean is
"Will you always be my girl
So we can dance together
In the midnight of the world?"

Of the world, yeah
In the midnight of the world
Of the world, yeah
In the midnight of the world
Of the world, yeah
In the midnight of the world
Of the world, take care
It's the midnight of the world

It's time I should be thankful
For all that I have got
Instead of bitching and complaining
Of all that I have not
I just forgot
That there are people with the blues
Who are living on the sidewalk
And sleeping in their shoes
They are the clues
That you must always be my girl
So we can dance together
In the midnight of the world

Of the world, yeah
In the midnight of the world
Of the world, yeah
In the midnight of the world
Of the world, yeah
In the midnight of the world
Of the world, take care
It's the midnight of the world
Of the world, say yeah
In the midnight of the world
