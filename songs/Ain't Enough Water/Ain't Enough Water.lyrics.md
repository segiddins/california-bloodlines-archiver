Hmm Hmm Hmm
Honey is the boat too small?
Hmm Hmm Hmm
I don't think it's gonna make the haul.
Well out on the lake
And the waves gonna break
I've a feeling like I'm gonna fall.
She said it's only a fall
Then she sang another song
And there wasn't any wind at all.

CHORUS:
Well there ain't enough water
For to really get a-rollin'
And there ain't enough wind to blow.
Well there ain't enough water
For to really get a-rollin'
And there ain't enough wind to blow.

Hmm Hmm Hmm
As I rumble on down the line.
Hmm Hmm Hmm
She was such a good friend of mine.
Well don't lose you cool
Stop acting like a fool
She's only got to let off steam.
She can scream, she can yell
Tell you go straight to hell
And you know it don't mean a thing.

Chorus

Spoken:
Well, I only want people to sing
Who have ever gotten drunk
Ever gotten stoned
Ever gotten paranoid
Ever done any foolin' around.
Now I know that I'm probably gonna be the only one singing
But I feel the time has come to be honest.
Okay, here I go.

Chorus repeat to fade
