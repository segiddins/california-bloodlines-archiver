Oh, Miss Mary
Where are you wanderin'
Oh, Miss Mary
Where are you wanderin'
Oh, Miss Mary
Where are you wanderin'
Three days and Mary's coming home

When Mary was a young girl
She took to wanderin'
Never would she leave me
And not come back again
I swear I hear her singing
Singing in the western wind
Three days and Mary's coming home

Oh, Miss Mary
Where are you wanderin'
Oh, Miss Mary
Where are you wanderin'
Oh, Miss Mary
Where are you wanderin'
Three days and Mary's coming home

Mary chased a rainbow
Over the mountains
Crossed so many rivers, Lord
That I can't count them
She wouldn't want those rainbows
Even if she found them
Three days and Mary's coming home

Oh, Miss Mary
Where are you wanderin'
Oh, Miss Mary
Where are you wanderin'
Oh, Miss Mary
Where are you wanderin'
Three days and Mary's coming home

Watching for my Mary
Wish she were home again
Home from the rivers, Lord
Home from the mountains
If I turned my back to sail
She'd just be gone again
Three days and Mary's coming home

Oh, Miss Mary
Where are you wanderin'
Oh, Miss Mary
Where are you wanderin'
Oh, Miss Mary
Where are you wanderin'
Three days and Mary's coming home

Oh, Miss Mary
Where are you wanderin'
Oh, Miss Mary
Where are you wanderin'
Oh, Miss Mary
Where are you wanderin'
Three days and Mary's coming
Three days and Mary's coming
Three days and Mary's coming home
