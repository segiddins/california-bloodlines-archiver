(Am)
Out across the heartland, yeah,
People on the move.
Sometimes, ah, they can't win,
And sometimes, ah, they can't lose.
And (D)sometimes they are hopeless, yeah,
And sometimes they are blue,
(Am) Sometimes they are looking
A (E7)lot like me and you. (Am)
(D)  (Am)  (D)  (Am)

You say you like my moves,
But you don't like my style.
You say you like my shoes,
But you don't like my smile.
Oh, (D)you are Mister Perfect, yeah,
They don't make that kind,
(Am) When I start open up your eyes
Unless you're (E)deaf and dumb and blind.

Are you (Am) waiting for saints
To be born in the light?
But they (E)are not born,
They just appear
And walk out of the (Am)night.
(D) (Am)  (D) (Am)  (D) (Am)  (D)

(Am) I guess you were lonely,
So you fell in love.
That's what you had told me, yeah,
When push had come to shove.
You're (D)always disappointed, yeah,
They never measure up.
Well, (Am)get your list of all you've missed
And (E) come and fill your cup.

Are you just (Am) waiting for saints
To be born in the light?
But they (E)are not born,
They just appear
And walk out of the (Am)night.
(D) (Am)  (D) (Am)  (D) (Am)  (D)

(Am) If you knew the grass is greener,
You ain't got a clue.
What you got is mighty hot
And good enough for you.
So, (D)why not just surrender, yeah?
It's one thing you can do.
(Am) Take a friend and then you kiss,
(E)What have you got, what have you got to lose?

And you are (Am) waiting for saints
To be born in the light?
But they (E)are not born,
They just appear
And walk out of the (Am)night.

Are you waiting for saints
To be born in the light?
But they (E)are not born,
They just appear
And walk out of the (Am)night. (D) (Am)
