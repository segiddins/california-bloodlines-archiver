Out across the heartland
People on the move
Sometimes they can't win
Sometimes they can't lose
Sometimes they are hopeless
Sometimes they are blue
Sometimes they are looking 
A lot like me and you

You say you like my moves
But you don't like my style
You say you like my shoes
But you don't like my smile
You are Mister Perfect 
They don't make that kind
When I start open up your eyes
Unless you are deaf and dumb and blind

Chorus:
Are you waiting for saints
To be born in the light?
But they are not born
They just appear 
And walk out of the night

I guess you were lonely
So you fell in love
That's what you have told me
If push had come to shove
You're always disappointed 
They never measure up
Get your list of all you've missed
And come and fill your cup

(Repeat Chorus)

If you knew the grass is greener
You ain't got a clue
What you got is mighty hot
And good enough for you
Why not just surrender 
It's one thing you can do
Take a friend and then you kiss
What have you got, got to lose?

(Repeat Chorus)
