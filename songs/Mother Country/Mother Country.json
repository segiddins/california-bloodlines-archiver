    "Lyrics": "There was a story in the San Francisco Chronicle that of course I forgot to save\nBut it was about a lady who lived in the 'good old days'\nWhen a century was born and a century had died\nAnd about these 'good old days' the old lady replied\n\"Why they were just a lot of people doing the best they could\"\n\"Just a lot of people doing the best they could\"\nAnd then the lady said that they did it, \"pretty up and walking good\"\n\nWhat ever happened to those faces in the old photographs\nI mean, the little boys…….\nBoys? . . . . . Hell they were men\nWho stood knee deep in the Johnstown mud\nIn the time of that terrible flood\nAnd they listened to the water, that awful noise\nAnd then they put away the dreams that belonged to little boys\n\nAnd the sun is going down for Mister Bouie \nAs he's singing with his class of nineteen-two\nOh, mother country, I do love you\nOh, mother country, I do love you\n\nI knew a man named E.A.Stuart, spelled  S.T.U.A.R.T.\nAnd he owned some of the finest horses that I think I've ever seen\nAnd he had one favorite, a champion, the old Campaigner\nAnd he called her \"Sweetheart On Parade\"\nAnd she was easily the finest horse that the good Lord ever made\nBut old E.A.Stuart, he was going blind\nAnd he said \"Before I go, I gotta drive her one more time\"\nSo people came from miles around, and they stood around the ring\nNo one said a word\nYou know, no one said a thing\nThen here they come, E.A. Stuart in the wagon right behind\nSitting straight and proud and he's driving her stone blind\nAnd would you look at her\nOh, she never looked finer or went better than today\nIt's E.A. Stuart and the old Campaigner, \"Sweetheart On Parade\"\nAnd the people cheered\nWhy I even saw a grown man break right down and cry\nAnd you know it was just a little while later that old E.A. Stuart died\n\nAnd the sun it is going down for Mister Bouie\nAs he's singing with his class of nineteen-two\nOh mother country, I do love you\nOh mother country, I do love you\n\n",
