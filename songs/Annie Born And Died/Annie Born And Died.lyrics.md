Born today, a new relation
Quiet hush in a pink front room
A bloodstone birthstone they will give her
Annie born on a summer afternoon

And home today, school vacation
Quiet laughs in a yellow front room
Her own curbstone, shoes of leather
Annie home on a summer afternoon

Held today, a celebration
Wedding veil in a white front room
A diamond ringstone he will give her
Annie married on a summer afternoon

Gone today, an old relation
Quiet hush in black front room
One lone tombstone they will give her
Annie died on a summer afternoon

Annie born and died
Annie born and died
It was just a little song
Called Annie born and died
