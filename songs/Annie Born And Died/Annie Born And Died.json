    "Lyrics": "Born today, a new relation\nQuiet hush in a pink front room\nA bloodstone birthstone they will give her\nAnnie born on a summer afternoon\n\nAnd home today, school vacation\nQuiet laughs in a yellow front room\nHer own curbstone, shoes of leather\nAnnie home on a summer afternoon\n\nHeld today, a celebration\nWedding veil in a white front room\nA diamond ringstone he will give her\nAnnie married on a summer afternoon\n\nGone today, an old relation\nQuiet hush in black front room\nOne lone tombstone they will give her\nAnnie died on a summer afternoon\n\nAnnie born and died\nAnnie born and died\nIt was just a little song\nCalled Annie born and died\n\n",
