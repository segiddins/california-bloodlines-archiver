We were twenty miles from Albany
Forget it I never shall
What a heck of a time we spent that night
On the E-rye-e canal
On the E-rye-e canal

Oh the E-rye-e was risin'
And the gin was gettin' low
And I hardly think that we'll get another drink
Til we get to Buffalo
Til we get to Buffalo

We were loaded down with barley
And the crew was full of rye
And the captain he looked down on me
With the gawl darned evil eye
With the gawl darned evil eye

Oh the E-rye-e was risin'
And the gin was gettin' low
And I hardly think that we'll get another drink
Til we get to Buffalo
Til we get to Buffalo

Oh the cook she was a kind old soul
She had a ragged dress
We hung her up upon a pole
As a signal of distress
As a signal of distress

Oh the E-rye-e was risin'
And the gin was gettin' low
And I hardly think that we'll get another drink
Til we get to Buffalo
Til we get to Buffalo

Now the cook she died of hunger
and the captain he went to jail
And I'm the only son of a gun
That's left to tell the tale
That's left to tell the tale

Oh the E-rye-e was risin'
And the gin was gettin' low
And I hardly think that we'll get another drink
Til we get to Buffalo
Til we get to Buffalo
Til we get to Buffalo
Til we get to Buffalo
