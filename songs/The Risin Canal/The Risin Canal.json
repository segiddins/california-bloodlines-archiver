    "Lyrics": "We were twenty miles from Albany\nForget it I never shall\nWhat a heck of a time we spent that night\nOn the E-rye-e canal\nOn the E-rye-e canal\n\nOh the E-rye-e was risin'\nAnd the gin was gettin' low\nAnd I hardly think that we'll get another drink\nTil we get to Buffalo\nTil we get to Buffalo\n\nWe were loaded down with barley\nAnd the crew was full of rye\nAnd the captain he looked down on me\nWith the gawl darned evil eye\nWith the gawl darned evil eye\n\nOh the E-rye-e was risin'\nAnd the gin was gettin' low\nAnd I hardly think that we'll get another drink\nTil we get to Buffalo\nTil we get to Buffalo\n\nOh the cook she was a kind old soul\nShe had a ragged dress\nWe hung her up upon a pole\nAs a signal of distress\nAs a signal of distress\n\nOh the E-rye-e was risin'\nAnd the gin was gettin' low\nAnd I hardly think that we'll get another drink\nTil we get to Buffalo\nTil we get to Buffalo\n\nNow the cook she died of hunger\nand the captain he went to jail\nAnd I'm the only son of a gun\nThat's left to tell the tale\nThat's left to tell the tale\n\nOh the E-rye-e was risin'\nAnd the gin was gettin' low\nAnd I hardly think that we'll get another drink\nTil we get to Buffalo\nTil we get to Buffalo\nTil we get to Buffalo\nTil we get to Buffalo\n\n",
