And a woman rides the beast
In the seven hills of the fallen priests
And a woman rides the beast

She may promise that you won't burn
For gold and silver in return
And perhaps for a larger fee
She will set your fathers free

The one who rides in glass and wheels
And draws the line where he reveals
That true that only God imparts
But can he speak to the hungry hearts
About the martyrs, about the Jews
About the ancient holy news?

And a woman rides the beast
In the seven hills of the fallen priests
And a woman rides the beast
In the seven hills of the fallen priests
And a woman rides the beast

When Satan offered Jesus the Kingdom of the Earth
But he knew salvation's worth
I'm glad he harbored wearing jewels and gold
Along the road where fools will go
The Prince of Peace said cast no stones
And those who seek are not alone
In politics it is no part
Of the Kingdom of the Lion Heart

And a woman rides the beast
In the seven hills of the fallen priests
And a woman rides the beast
In the seven hills of the fallen priests
And a woman rides the beast

And a woman rides the beast
And a woman rides the beast
In the seven hills of the fallen priests
