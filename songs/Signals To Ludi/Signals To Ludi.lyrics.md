They were burning black widows in the Alderman cave-in today
Ludi was crying, she told me she ran all the way
Yeah, she knew they were dying
So what could I say

A woodpecker mama was nesting up high in the leaves
Some kids with an air gun were shooting her out of the tree
And they called over Ludi
Just so she could see

Falling star fade away
Falling star fade away
They're signals to Ludi
An Angel’s on its way
See the falling star fade away

Some guy down in Texas, I hear went right out of his head
I see by the paper that six sorry people are dead
Thank the Lord little Ludi
Can't read what it said

Falling star fade away
Falling star fade away
They're signals to Ludi
An Angel’s on its way
See the falling star fade away

They were burning black widows 
In the Alderman cave-in today
