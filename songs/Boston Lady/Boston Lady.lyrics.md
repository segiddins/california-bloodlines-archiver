A cat-o-ninetails cracks on a small of your back
And your sail lies slack in the sun
Your ships lying dead and the deck's turning red
In the back of my head, a prayer I said
To see my Boston lady

There's a hurricane blowing on the eastern sea
But the storm ain't meaning a thing to me
Been adrift here for ninety-nine days
Lord of the wind I will find a way
To see my Boston lady
My Boston lady

And I pray to the wind on a Christian hymn
To see my Boston lady
And I pray to the wind on a Christian hymn
To see my Boston lady

A cat-o-ninetails cracks on a small of your back
And your sail lies slack in the sun
Your ships lying dead and the deck's turning red
In the back of my head a prayer I said
To see my Boston lady
My Boston lady

And I pray to the wind on a Christian hymn
To see my Boston lady
And I pray to the wind on a Christian hymn
To see my Boston lady
My Boston lady
My Boston lady
