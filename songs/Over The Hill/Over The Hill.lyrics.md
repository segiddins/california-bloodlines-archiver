Sucking wind, I'm slipping down the back road once again
And I'm on the run, slipping down the back road in the sun
And I'm taking flight, oh, I'm slipping down the back road in the night
And I'm running still, slipping down and over the hill

For so long, oh, I've been out there looking for a song
And it's just insane, it's like trying to run and chase a moving train
And you understand, oh, aren't you trying to find the Promised Land
And you will, slipping down and over the hill

Oh, it's over the hill
Over the hill
And oh, yes I will
Slipping down and over the hill

Sucking wind, I'm slipping down the back road once again
And I'm on the run, slipping down the back road in the sun
And I'm taking flight, oh, I'm slipping down the back road in the night
And I'm running still, slipping down and over the hill

Oh, it's over the hill
Over the hill
Over the hill
Over the hill
