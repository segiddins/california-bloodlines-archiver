    "Lyrics": "Sucking wind, I'm slipping down the back road once again\nAnd I'm on the run, slipping down the back road in the sun\nAnd I'm taking flight, oh, I'm slipping down the back road in the night\nAnd I'm running still, slipping down and over the hill\n\nFor so long, oh, I've been out there looking for a song\nAnd it's just insane, it's like trying to run and chase a moving train\nAnd you understand, oh, aren't you trying to find the Promised Land\nAnd you will, slipping down and over the hill\n\nOh, it's over the hill\nOver the hill\nAnd oh, yes I will\nSlipping down and over the hill\n\nSucking wind, I'm slipping down the back road once again\nAnd I'm on the run, slipping down the back road in the sun\nAnd I'm taking flight, oh, I'm slipping down the back road in the night\nAnd I'm running still, slipping down and over the hill\n\nOh, it's over the hill\nOver the hill\nOver the hill\nOver the hill\n\n",
