Hold on the line
Wait for a sign
Slippin’ and a slidin’ in the hole
Hold on the line
Wait for a sign
We are diamonds in the coal

Holdin’ on the rails
Clinging with your nails
Slippin’ and a slidin’ in the hole
You know without fail
The tipping of the scales
We are diamonds in the coal

We are diamonds, we are diamonds
We are diamonds in the coal

Don’t give up now
Make it through somehow
Though we’re slippin’ and a slidin’ in the hole
And if we’re in the night
There’s bound to be a light
Like a diamond in the coal

We are diamonds, we are diamonds
We are diamonds in the coal
