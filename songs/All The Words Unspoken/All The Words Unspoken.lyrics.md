All the words unspoken
All the dogs in chains
All the walls still standing
They will own you, baby Jane

Will they just stay inside your throat
Until one day they're heard
So take a chance and free yourself
And you will free the words

Just say the words
Say the words
Oh say the words
Won’t you say the words

Well you wrote to me in letters
That flowed right from your heart
And you wrote the words "I Love You" 
And they tore my blues apart

Oh but when I call you on the phone
The conversation’s blurred
So take a chance and free yourself
And you will free the words

Say the words
Say the words
Won’t you say the words
Just say the words

All the words unspoken
All the dogs in chains
All the walls still standing
All alone will be retained

Will they just say inside your throat
Until one day they're heard
So take a chance and free yourself
And you will free the words

Say the words
Say the words
Won’t you say the words
Just say the words
