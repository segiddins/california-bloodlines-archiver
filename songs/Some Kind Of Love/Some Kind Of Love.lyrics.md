Some kind of love is like gold
And that is the hardest to hold
For it catches the eye
Of each thief passing by
Some kind of love is like gold

Some kind of love comes too soon
That kind of love heals your wounds
When your wounds are all healed
And you're back on your wheels
You say that kind of love came too soon

Some kind of love, some kind of love
Everyone's looking for some kind of love
Some kind of love, some kind of love
Everyone's looking for some kind of love

Some kind of love starts as friends
That kind of love never ends
For it comes on as slow
As a flower in snow
Some kind of love starts as friends

Some kind of love tears your heart
When you knew it was wrong from the start
Try to explain
A moth to a flame
Some kind of love tears your heart

Some kind of love, some kind of love
Everyone's looking for some kind of love
Some kind of love, some kind of love
Everyone's looking for some kind of love

Some kind of love never dies
That is the hardest to find
Through laughter and rage
It mellows with age
Some kind of love never dies

Some kind of love is like gold
And that is the hardest to hold
For it catches the eye
Of each thief passing by
Some kind of love is like gold

Some kind of love, some kind of love
Everyone's looking for some kind of love
Some kind of love, some kind of love
Everyone's looking for some kind of love
