Well he left his home in San Jose
He was just a boy of nine
And he'd only gone a mile to find
He didn't have a dime
He didn't have a dime

He said, "Mamma have you got a dollar?
Oh, Mamma when you're off the phone."
But Mamma kept talkin'
And the boy kept walkin'
Without a road of his own
Oh, no, no, no
Mamma don't you know

You're takin' my road away
Oh, road away
You got a road of your own
You're takin' my road away
Oh, road away
You got a road of your own, your own
You got a road of your own

Well  he came to the Mission San Luis Rey
Lupe Jones was doing well
She owned a Ford and served the Lord
And rang the mission bell
Rang the mission bell

She turned him on
And she turned him down
And she turned him over slowly
Stay with me and I'll fill your needs
The boy he answered lowly
"No, no, no
Lupe don't you know"

You're takin' my road away
Oh, road away
You got a road of your own
You're takin' my road away
Oh, road away
You got a road of your own, your own
You got a road of your own

You're takin' my road away
Oh, road away
You got a road of your own
You're takin' my road away
Oh, road away
You got a road of your own, your own
You got a road of your own

You're takin' my road away
Oh, road away
You got a road of your own
You're takin' my road away
Oh, road away
You got a road of your own, your own
You got a road of your own
