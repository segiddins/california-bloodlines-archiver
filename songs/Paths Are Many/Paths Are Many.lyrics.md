It's hard to say one size fits all
Some are big and some are small
Some are short and some are tall
It's hard to say one size fits all

You say black and I say white
You say wrong and I say right
You say day and I say night
It could take a lifetime to get it right

But truth is one, and paths are many
Are you having fun, I'm not having any
You can find the sun or you can find a penny
Truth is one, and paths are many

You're a Catholic and I'm a Jew
I don't think we have a clue
There's a Hindu chant carved in the pew
But any rosary beads will do
Any rosary beads will do

Some say truth is a long white beard
Some say truth is to be feared
Some say truth is just too darn weird
Some say truth, yeah I see it clear

But truth is one, and paths are many
Are you having fun, I'm not having any
You can find the sun or you can find a penny
Truth is one, and paths are many
Yeah, paths are many

It flows through me and it flows through you
No argument, it is too
It flows through me and it flows through you

Paths are many
Oh, truth is one, paths are many
Paths are many
Truth is one
Truth is one
Paths are many
