    "Lyrics": "You could spend a lifetime\nWaiting for the guru\nSomeone here must know\nThe way home\nYou can make believe that\nYou do\n\nThe dark wings on a cadmium sky\nThe priest he hears the breeze\nBut does he know where the wind comes from\nWhat is up his sleeve?\n\nSunday morning TV\nIs filled with flags and God\nThe symbols of the heartland\nThe lightning and the rod\nSure, they can take your money\nThey can even bend the light\nBut it’s whatever makes you feel the words\nIt all is gonna be all right\n\nChorus:\n\nOh Oh Oh\nIt can’t be worlds away\nIt’s only where the wind comes from\nIt’s the wheel within the clay\nThe wheel within the clay\n\nYou can spend a lifetime\nWaiting for the guru\nSilence makes you look inside\nI’ll bet that’s what you do\nThere’s a clear voice speaking\nIt has a lot to say\nBut it’s only where the wind comes from\nIt’s the wheel within the clay\n\n(Repeat Chorus)\n\n\n",
