You could spend a lifetime
Waiting for the guru
Someone here must know
The way home
You can make believe that
You do

The dark wings on a cadmium sky
The priest he hears the breeze
But does he know where the wind comes from
What is up his sleeve?

Sunday morning TV
Is filled with flags and God
The symbols of the heartland
The lightning and the rod
Sure, they can take your money
They can even bend the light
But it’s whatever makes you feel the words
It all is gonna be all right

Chorus:

Oh Oh Oh
It can’t be worlds away
It’s only where the wind comes from
It’s the wheel within the clay
The wheel within the clay

You can spend a lifetime
Waiting for the guru
Silence makes you look inside
I’ll bet that’s what you do
There’s a clear voice speaking
It has a lot to say
But it’s only where the wind comes from
It’s the wheel within the clay

(Repeat Chorus)
