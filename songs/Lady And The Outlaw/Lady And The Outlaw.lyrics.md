They say that every woman
At one time or another
Wishes that the man in her arms
Was an outlaw
And they say that every outlaw
At one time or another
Wishes that the girl in his arms
Was a lady

One hand on the lady
And one on the contraband
One eye down the river
Lookin' for a jealous man

Please let your hair down, honey
Please while the moon is bright
As the lady and the outlaw
They forget who they are tonight

Please let your hair down, honey
Please while the moon is bright
As the lady and the outlaw
They forget who they are tonight

Please let your hair down, honey
Please while the moon is bright
As the lady and the outlaw
They forget who they are tonight

One hand on the lady
And one on the contraband
One eye down the river
Lookin' for a jealous man

Please let your hair down, honey
Please while the moon is bright
As the lady and the outlaw
They forget who they are tonight
 
Please let your hair down, honey
Please while the moon is bright

Please let your hair down, honey
Please while the moon is bright

Please let your hair down, honey
Please while the moon is bright

Please let your hair down, honey
Please while the moon is bright
