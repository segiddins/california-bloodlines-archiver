Where are you going with the rain?
Little boy I wish that you'd explain
"I'm gonna take my friend the rain
Where he won't hear anyone complain
He won't have to hear those straight faced liars,
Or bad mouth talkers or mean back fighters
That's where I'm going with the rain"

Where are you going with the wind
There's no place I know that she ain't been
"I'm gonna take my friend the wind
So she can blow where the stars begin
She won't have to hear those straight faced liars,
Or bad mouth talkers or mean back fighters
That's where I'm going with the wind"

Where are you going with my heart
Little boy I guess I'm not so smart
"I'm gonna take my friend your heart
To keep the world from breaking it apart
You won't have to hear those straight faced liars,
Or bad mouth talkers or mean back fighters
That's where I'm going with your heart
That's where I'm going with the wind
That's where I'm going with the rain"
