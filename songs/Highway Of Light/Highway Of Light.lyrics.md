Run to the crossroads
To the bright shining crossroads
Follow the sparrow
To the highway of light

Oh and run to the crossroads
The bright shining crossroads
The children will lead you
To the highway of light

And those who are weary
Run to the crossroads
Follow the sparrow
To the highway of light

And those who are weary
You’ll never be weary
For the children will lead you
To the highway of light

And those are troubled
Run to the crossroads
Follow the sparrow
To the highway of light

And those who are troubled
Your angels are doubled
When you follow the childen
To the highway of light

Run the crossroads
The bright shining crossroads
Follow the sparrow
To the highway of light

And run to the crossroads
The bright shinging crossroads
The children will lead you
To the highway of light

And those with a sorrow
Run the crossroads
Follow the sparrow
To the highway of light

And those with a sorrow
Shinin’ tomorrow
And the children will lead you
To the highway of light

And you run the crossroads
To the bright shining crossroads
Follow the sparrow
To the highway of light

And you run to the crossroads
The bright shining crossroads
For the children will lead you
To the highway of light
