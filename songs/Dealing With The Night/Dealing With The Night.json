    "Lyrics": "Kiss me in the shadows \nKiss me in the dark\nKiss to me the secrets of the lovers of Hyde Park\nKiss to me the reasons for a thousand sleepless nights.\nKiss to me a lover on the streets of shadow light.\nKiss to me a lover on the streets of shadow light\n\nRain drops on the comer. \nThe Columbia Hotel who hides in the shadows \nThe lips that never tell\nNight was made for lovers or were lovers made for night. \nKiss to me a lover on the streets of shadow light.\nKiss to me a lover on the streets of shadow light.\n\nChorus:\n\nAll of my life\nI’ve been dealing with the night.\nAll of my life\nI’ve been dealing with the night.\nOver and over again\nLike the blade of a knife. \nDealing with the night \nI’ve been dealing with the night.\n\n(Repeat 1st verse and chorus) \n\n\n",
