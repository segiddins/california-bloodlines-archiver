Kiss me in the shadows 
Kiss me in the dark
Kiss to me the secrets of the lovers of Hyde Park
Kiss to me the reasons for a thousand sleepless nights.
Kiss to me a lover on the streets of shadow light.
Kiss to me a lover on the streets of shadow light

Rain drops on the comer. 
The Columbia Hotel who hides in the shadows 
The lips that never tell
Night was made for lovers or were lovers made for night. 
Kiss to me a lover on the streets of shadow light.
Kiss to me a lover on the streets of shadow light.

Chorus:

All of my life
I’ve been dealing with the night.
All of my life
I’ve been dealing with the night.
Over and over again
Like the blade of a knife. 
Dealing with the night 
I’ve been dealing with the night.

(Repeat 1st verse and chorus)
