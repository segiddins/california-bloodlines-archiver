Sometimes, early in the morning
Sometimes, when the world goes around
Oh, there was one lie that I was believing
That dream girls never bring you down

I know somebody's daughter
She didn't mean wrong when she said those things
She said that I was the oil on the water
She was an Angel who had found her wings

And when your love's gone early in the morning
And when your love's gone early in the day
And when your love's gone long about midnight
When your love's gone
It's the American way
And when your love's gone
Ok, it's the American way

Sometimes, early in the morning
Sometimes, when the world goes around
Oh, there was one lie that I was believing
That dream girls never bring you down

And when your love's gone early in the morning
And when your love's gone early in the day
And when your love's gone long about midnight
When your love's gone
It's the American way
And when your love's gone
Ok, it's the American way

And when your love's gone
