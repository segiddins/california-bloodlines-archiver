My brother stirred the Kool Aid. Give him Sipz
Two cents and a penny buys a pair of big wax lips
Riding with no hands around the turn
Let's find a guy named Francis and give him an indian burn
And we can go tell Roger there's another face looking in the window

Dancing with my clothes on in the rain
Let's make some funny phone calls to some folks with funny names
Albert holds his breath when he gets mad
That's when I really like him cause his breath is really bad
And we can go tell Roger there's another face looking in the window

I know that Lucy Higgins still loves me
Cause she hit me with her lunch pail when I kicked her on the knee
My brother stirred the Kool Aid. Give him Sipz
Two cents and a penny buys a pair of big wax lips
And we can go tell Roger there's another face looking in the window
Looking in the window
Looking in the window
Looking in the window
