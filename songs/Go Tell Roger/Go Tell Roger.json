    "Lyrics": "My brother stirred the Kool Aid. Give him Sipz\nTwo cents and a penny buys a pair of big wax lips\nRiding with no hands around the turn\nLet's find a guy named Francis and give him an indian burn\nAnd we can go tell Roger there's another face looking in the window\n\nDancing with my clothes on in the rain\nLet's make some funny phone calls to some folks with funny names\nAlbert holds his breath when he gets mad\nThat's when I really like him cause his breath is really bad\nAnd we can go tell Roger there's another face looking in the window\n\nI know that Lucy Higgins still loves me\nCause she hit me with her lunch pail when I kicked her on the knee\nMy brother stirred the Kool Aid. Give him Sipz\nTwo cents and a penny buys a pair of big wax lips\nAnd we can go tell Roger there's another face looking in the window\nLooking in the window\nLooking in the window\nLooking in the window\n\n",
