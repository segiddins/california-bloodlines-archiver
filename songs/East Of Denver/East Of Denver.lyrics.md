Oh, if I never go east of Denver again
Denver again, Denver again
If I never go east of Denver again
It'll be too soon, honey, it'll be too soon

Hi-de hi-de hi-de ho
You can have your Chicago
It blew me down and it laid me low
Hi-de hi-de hi-de ho

Yeah, if I never go east of Denver again
Denver again, yeah, Denver again
Oh, if I never go east of Denver again
It'll be too soon, honey, itÂ´ll be too soon

Bangor, Maine and Alabam'
The sweetest people, honey lamb
But the weather there is "Holy damn!"
Bangor, Maine and Alabam'

Yeah, if I never go east of Denver again
Denver again, Denver again
If I never go east of Denver again
It'll be too soon, honey, it'll be too soon

Yeah, if I never go east of Denver again
Denver again, ah, Denver again
If I never go east of Denver again
It'll be too soon, honey, it'll be too soon


Additional verse not recorded:

Let me stay with the one I love
She fits me like a buckskin glove
And the western sky shines above
Let me stay with the one I love
