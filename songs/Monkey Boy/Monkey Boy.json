    "Lyrics": "There was a murder in the neighborhood\nSomebody shot his wife\nLook at her Billy lyin' on the ground there\nShe looked absolutely white\nAnd we all smelled the tear gas\nNone of us could see\nIt was so exciting\nNone of us could leave\n\nHow about them bullies in the schoolyard\nThere was nowhere I could run\nI knew I couldn't lick 'em'\nCouldn't shoot them with a gun\nYou know they beat me silly\nThat's the way it goes\nNow I'm seein bullies\nEverywhere I go\n\nChorus:\nAnd it's hard time for the monkey boy\nHard times for the boy\nHard times, when you're looking in the mirror \nHard times for the monkey boy\n\nMy Daddy was a mean man\nDon't ask me why\nHe liked fighting with my Mama\nI believe just to see her cry\nYou know she never left him\nAh she never did\nShe always used to tell me\nShe did it for the kids\n\nHe left me in the desert once\nHigh noon in the middle of the week\nWay out in Winslow Arizona\nWe had stopped to take a leak\nHe said he didn't know \nThat I had gotten out\nI don't think he would have left me\nBut still I have my doubts\n\n(Repeat Chorus)\n\nHow about them guineas on the racetrack?\nThey're a tough hard living bunch\nThey like sleeping in the tack room\nJack Daniels was their lunch\nThey were always nice to me\nKept me out of harm\nWhile I was just keeping\nAway from my Daddy's arm\n\n(Repeat Chorus)\n\n(Additional Lyrics)\n\nI had a blue Schwinn bike\nIt was my joy it was my pride\nI’d pretend it was a motorcycle\nGoing on a highway ride\nI would make a great escape\nJust around the bend\nThe road goes on forever\nAnd I’m never seen again\n\n(Repeat Chorus)\n\n",
