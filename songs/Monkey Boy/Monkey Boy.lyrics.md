There was a murder in the neighborhood
Somebody shot his wife
Look at her Billy lyin' on the ground there
She looked absolutely white
And we all smelled the tear gas
None of us could see
It was so exciting
None of us could leave

How about them bullies in the schoolyard
There was nowhere I could run
I knew I couldn't lick 'em'
Couldn't shoot them with a gun
You know they beat me silly
That's the way it goes
Now I'm seein bullies
Everywhere I go

Chorus:
And it's hard time for the monkey boy
Hard times for the boy
Hard times, when you're looking in the mirror 
Hard times for the monkey boy

My Daddy was a mean man
Don't ask me why
He liked fighting with my Mama
I believe just to see her cry
You know she never left him
Ah she never did
She always used to tell me
She did it for the kids

He left me in the desert once
High noon in the middle of the week
Way out in Winslow Arizona
We had stopped to take a leak
He said he didn't know 
That I had gotten out
I don't think he would have left me
But still I have my doubts

(Repeat Chorus)

How about them guineas on the racetrack?
They're a tough hard living bunch
They like sleeping in the tack room
Jack Daniels was their lunch
They were always nice to me
Kept me out of harm
While I was just keeping
Away from my Daddy's arm

(Repeat Chorus)

(Additional Lyrics)

I had a blue Schwinn bike
It was my joy it was my pride
I’d pretend it was a motorcycle
Going on a highway ride
I would make a great escape
Just around the bend
The road goes on forever
And I’m never seen again

(Repeat Chorus)
