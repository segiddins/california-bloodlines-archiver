Harkin, the dogs are barking
Out on the road there's a law man parking
Living in an Oklahoma loner's sunstorm

Harkin, the rain is gone
Rain maker praying that he don't go wrong
Living in an Oklahoma loner's sunstorm

Sunrise, come burn your eyes
And it won't take long to realize
You're living in an Oklahoma loner's sunstorm

Harkin, your friend is lost
You can curse the road but the road is boss
Living in an Oklahoma loner's sunstorm

Harkin, the wind will blow
Gonna blow your tail like a rodeo
Living in an Oklahoma loner's sunstorm

Sunrise, come burn your eyes
And it won't take long to realize
You're living in an Oklahoma loner's sunstorm
