I heard the highway whine when I was a kid
Dreaming of the long white line was all that I did
Oh, a man behind the wheel ain't a man on the skids
I heard the highway whine when I was a kid

A little taste of freedom and I was gone
A highway rider, I could not go wrong
Oh, those backseat nights when Sally was along
A little taste of freedom all night long

Yeah, to ride on the wheels of thunder
Taking over, now going under
Yeah to ride on the wheels of thunder
Watch 'em roll
Yeah to ride on the wheels of thunder
Taking over, now going under
Yeah to ride on the wheels of thunder
Watch 'em roll

That old Chevy was all that I'd ever need
I had the moves and I knew that she had the speed
On those backseat nights when I was in by three
That old Chevy was all that I'd ever need

Ah, to ride on the wheels of thunder
Taking over, now going under
Yeah, to ride on the wheels of thunder
Watch 'em roll
Yeah to ride on the wheels of thunder
Taking over, now going under
Yeah to ride on the wheels of thunder
Watch 'em roll
