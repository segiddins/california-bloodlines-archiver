I ain't asking to cry on your shoulder
I don't want to see your happiness folder
I gotta sing when things go wrong
I gotta sing a runaway song

And I run, (run, run, run) run away
I run, (run, run, run) run away
Fly, fly away
Sneak away, fly away
Watch me as I get away
Anyway I can run away

Don't need a man with a pocketful of causes
Says he knows who Santa Claus is
Talking 'bout a war I should renounce
Over in a country with a name I can't pronounce

And I run, (run, run, run) run away
I run, (run, run, run) run away
Fly, fly away
Sneak away, fly away
Watch me as I get away
Anyway I can run away

I run, run away
I run, (run, run, run) run away
Fly, fly away
Anyway I can run away
