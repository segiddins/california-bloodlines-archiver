One shining day
It’ll all be working and going our way
One shining day
There’ll be food on the table and the devil to pay

One shining day
All of the dogs will be having their day
One shining day
Up from the valley we are making our way

It’s the high that you’re in when the wheel does spin
Looking for the gold where the rainbow ends
It’s the high that you’re in when the wheels do spin
Ooh yeah, one shining day

One shining day
It'll all be working and going our way
One shining day
Up from the valley we are making our way

It’s the high that you’re in when the wheel does spin
Looking for the gold where the rainbow ends
It’s the high that you’re in when the wheel does spin
Ooh yeah, one shining day
