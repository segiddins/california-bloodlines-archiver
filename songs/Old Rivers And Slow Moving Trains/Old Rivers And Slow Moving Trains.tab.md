(C)  (G)  (C)  (G)  (C)  (G)  (C)  (G)  
Sunny (C)skies 
(G) Would never (Am)show without the (Em)rain,
Happy (F)times 
(C) We'd never (F)know without the (G)pain.
Rea(C)lize 
(G)That you (Am)have no one to (Em)blame.
Moving (F)on like old (C)rivers,
And (F)slow (G)rolling (Am)trains,
(Em)Moving (F)on like old (C)rivers,
And (F)slow (G)rolling (C)trains.  (G)  (C)  (G)  

Lose it (C)all, 
(G) (Am)You might find it (Em)then,
Against the (F)wall, 
(C) But you'll (F)know who are your (G)friends.
And if you (C)fall, 
(G) (Am)You can rise a(Em)gain.
We're moving (F)on like old (C)rivers,
And (F)birds u(G)pon the (Am)wind,
WeÂ´re (Em)moving (F)on like old (C)rivers,
And (F)birds u(G)pon the (C)wind.

(F)Nothing good comes (G)easy,
(C)Nothing (G)easy's (Am)free...
And if (F)loving you is (G)all I do,
It's (C)still all (G)right with (Am)me.

So we (F)take along a(G)nother song,
Go (C)moving (G)with the (Am)change.
We're moving (F)on like old (C)rivers
And (F)slow (G)moving (Am)trains...
Moving (F)on like old (C)rivers,
And (F)slow (G)rolling (C)trains....
