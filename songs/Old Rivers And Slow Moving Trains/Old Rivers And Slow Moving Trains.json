    "Lyrics": "Sunny skies\nWould never show without the rain\nHappy times\nWe'd never know without the pain\nRealize\nThat you have no one to blame\nWe're moving on \nLike old rivers, and slow moving trains\nMoving on like old rivers\nAnd slow rolling trains...\n\nLose it all\nYou might find it then\nAgainst the wall\nBut you'll know who are your friends\nAnd if you fall\nYou can rise again\nWe're moving on\nLike old rivers, and birds upon the wind\nMoving on like old rivers\nAnd birds upon the wind...\n\nNothing good comes easy\nNothing easy's free\nAnd if loving you is all I do\nIt's still all right with me\n\nSo we'll take along another song\nGo moving with the change\nWe're moving on like old rivers\nAnd slow moving trains\nMoving on like old rivers\nAnd slow rolling trains...\n\n",
