Sunny skies
Would never show without the rain
Happy times
We'd never know without the pain
Realize
That you have no one to blame
We're moving on 
Like old rivers, and slow moving trains
Moving on like old rivers
And slow rolling trains...

Lose it all
You might find it then
Against the wall
But you'll know who are your friends
And if you fall
You can rise again
We're moving on
Like old rivers, and birds upon the wind
Moving on like old rivers
And birds upon the wind...

Nothing good comes easy
Nothing easy's free
And if loving you is all I do
It's still all right with me

So we'll take along another song
Go moving with the change
We're moving on like old rivers
And slow moving trains
Moving on like old rivers
And slow rolling trains...
