Clear the tracks, the song's been taken
This may be the last hurrah
In Tennessee they were forsaken
L.A. was the coup de grace

Clean your guns, the battle's over
They belong now to the wind
The saddest words I've ever spoken
Were the words "It might have been"

And it's all right, it's only music
It is singing in the stars
Keep your dreams as clean as silver
This may be the last hurrah

Loyal friends and front row dancers
Hitch you wagon to a star
A chilly wind blew cold this morning
This may be the last hurrah

And it's all right, it's only music
It is singing in the stars
Keep your dreams as clean as silver
This may be the last hurrah
This may be the last hurrah
