    "Lyrics": "Oh, marry the man when the moon was right\nAnd you've all had your way\nTrue love happens every day\nNow there's nowhere to hide with a child inside\nYou don't know what to say\nBut follow your heart all the way\n\nAnd you stand, you know, stand by the children\nYou got to stand, you know, stand by the children\nHere and on their way\nAnd you stand, you know, stand by the children\nOh it'll be their world someday\n\nYou can't measure a life with the blade of a knife\nIt just don't work that way\nEverybody should see the light of day\nAnd if this is the dance then give them a chance\n'Cause they might find the way\nTo follow your heart all the way\n\nAnd you stand, you know, stand by the children\nYou got to stand, you know, stand by the children\nStand by the children, stand by the children\n'Cause it'll be their world some day\n\nI remember the time when a guy with a dime\nAn old man on the street\nA neighbourhood was a place to meet\nAnd now danger hides where a stranger rides\nTo keep 'em safe you say\nTo follow your heart all the way\n\nAnd you stand, you know, stand by the children\nYou got to stand, you know, stand by the children\nHere and on their way\nAnd you stand, you know, stand by the children\nStand by the children, stand by the children by the children\n\n",
