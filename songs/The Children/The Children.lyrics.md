Oh, marry the man when the moon was right
And you've all had your way
True love happens every day
Now there's nowhere to hide with a child inside
You don't know what to say
But follow your heart all the way

And you stand, you know, stand by the children
You got to stand, you know, stand by the children
Here and on their way
And you stand, you know, stand by the children
Oh it'll be their world someday

You can't measure a life with the blade of a knife
It just don't work that way
Everybody should see the light of day
And if this is the dance then give them a chance
'Cause they might find the way
To follow your heart all the way

And you stand, you know, stand by the children
You got to stand, you know, stand by the children
Stand by the children, stand by the children
'Cause it'll be their world some day

I remember the time when a guy with a dime
An old man on the street
A neighbourhood was a place to meet
And now danger hides where a stranger rides
To keep 'em safe you say
To follow your heart all the way

And you stand, you know, stand by the children
You got to stand, you know, stand by the children
Here and on their way
And you stand, you know, stand by the children
Stand by the children, stand by the children by the children
