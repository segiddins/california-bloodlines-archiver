I'm going down to the depot
Yeah, the Midnight train is on the track
I'm going down to the depot
And the Midnight train is on the track
They're bringing out the soldiers
Some are never coming back

I'm going down to the depot
Midnight train is almost there
I'm going down to the depot
El Presidente doesn't care
Presidente has two daughters
You will never find them there

I'm going down to the depot
And the Midnight train is right on time
I'm going down to the depot
And the Midnight train is right on time
And when I get my baby
We'll be moving down the line

Yeah, we're going to Savannah
Right on down to the Caroline
Yeah, we're going to Savannah
Right on through to the Caroline
And when I'm with my baby
Oh, these are the happy times

Yeah, they often called me Speedo
But my real name is-a Mr. Earl
Yeah, they often called me Speedo
But my real name was-a Mr. Earl
Yeah, and when I told my baby
She said, "Who the hell is Mr. Earl?"

I'm going down to the depot
Yeah, the Midnight train is on the track
Yeah, I'm going to the depot
And the Midnight train is on the track
They're bringing out the soldiers
Some are never coming back
