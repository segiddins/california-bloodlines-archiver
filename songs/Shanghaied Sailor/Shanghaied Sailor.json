    "Lyrics": "I was a San Francisco sailor \nWho was wanted by the law\nFor petty crimes and pandering\nBreaking sailors' jaws\n\nSo they locked me up \nAnd they threw me in\nTo the hold of the Portugese\nThey need hands and the China coast\nWould welcome Yankee thieves\n\nThree days out and the captain\nSaid \"aw you don't mean dirt to me\nBut on the China coast you'll all be kings\nAs you sail the Portugese\"\n\n\"China dolls will think you're god\nBut it's over when you leave\n'Cause Singpore kings are nothing more\nThan San Francisco thieves\"\n\nOh, Shanghaied sailor\nWith a China girl to leave\nSingapore kings were nothing more\nThan San Francisco thieves\n\n",
