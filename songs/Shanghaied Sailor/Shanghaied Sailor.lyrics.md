I was a San Francisco sailor 
Who was wanted by the law
For petty crimes and pandering
Breaking sailors' jaws

So they locked me up 
And they threw me in
To the hold of the Portugese
They need hands and the China coast
Would welcome Yankee thieves

Three days out and the captain
Said "aw you don't mean dirt to me
But on the China coast you'll all be kings
As you sail the Portugese"

"China dolls will think you're god
But it's over when you leave
'Cause Singpore kings are nothing more
Than San Francisco thieves"

Oh, Shanghaied sailor
With a China girl to leave
Singapore kings were nothing more
Than San Francisco thieves
