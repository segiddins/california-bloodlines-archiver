    "Lyrics": "I ain't jumped a freight train\nLike some others I've been told,\nAnd I ain't froze my tail off\nOn the highway in the cold.\n\nIf you thought I was doing wrong\nI wish to hell you'd say\nCause for all my life and maybe more\nI've been looking for the way.\n\nThank you Tom and thank you Glen\nFor giving me the news.\nI've had it soft and I've had it good\nAnd I never paid my dues.\n\nIf you thought I was doing wrong\nI wish to hell you'd say\nCause for all my life and maybe more\nI've been looking for the way.\n\nI've been down and I've been low\nAnd I have played the part.\nAnd I have loved and I have lost\nAnd it almost broke my heart.\n\nThe smartest man I ever knew\nHad just one thing to say.\nHe said, \"John, we're all lost and far from home\nAnd looking for the way\".\n\nAnd I guess I'm lost\nand far from home\nand still looking for the way\n\n",
