I ain't jumped a freight train
Like some others I've been told,
And I ain't froze my tail off
On the highway in the cold.

If you thought I was doing wrong
I wish to hell you'd say
Cause for all my life and maybe more
I've been looking for the way.

Thank you Tom and thank you Glen
For giving me the news.
I've had it soft and I've had it good
And I never paid my dues.

If you thought I was doing wrong
I wish to hell you'd say
Cause for all my life and maybe more
I've been looking for the way.

I've been down and I've been low
And I have played the part.
And I have loved and I have lost
And it almost broke my heart.

The smartest man I ever knew
Had just one thing to say.
He said, "John, we're all lost and far from home
And looking for the way".

And I guess I'm lost
and far from home
and still looking for the way
