There is something strange in the summer sky.
Something strange in things that fly
In silver suits and almond eyes.
Something strange in the summer sky.

If Jesse Marcel was still around,
He would tell us what he found
Lying on Mac Brasel's ground.
If Jesse Marcel was still around.

Chorus:
It’s as clear as a rose on a tattooed arm
What they found on Mac Brasel's farm
If you had seen in the Roswell barn
You must believe in Mac Brasel's farm
Mac Brasel's farm.

Walter Haut at the 509
Told the press,"It’s true this time.’
A saucer crashed and what they found
Was scattered all over Mac Brasel's ground.

If you believe after forty-five years
At the risk of their careers.
All of those who are still around,
Who saw the crash on Mac Brasel's ground.

Who drove the trucks and flew the planes
With things that just can’t be explained.
Who saw the faces and touched the arms
Of what they found on Mac Brasel's farm

The army speaks from secret rooms.
It was nothing more than a weather balloon.
Yet some live in fear of harm
For what they saw on Mac Brasel's farm.

(Repeat Chorus)

There’s a million stars in the summer sky
A million people wonder why.
That some who live in the desert sun
Seem to know that they have come.

(Repeat Chorus)
