    "Lyrics": "Sunrise, colouring the highway\nYour eyes, sleeping in the sun\nAnd when you rise and listen to the song again\nThen you'll know, that the wings have come\n\nDark wings, shadow on the highway\nThe wind sings, following the sun\nAnd when you rise and listen to the song again\nThen you'll know, that the wings have come\n\nThere are wings, of the raven on the wind\nThere are wings, of the raven on the wind\nTugging at my lifeline\nCalling me again\n\nA long rain, is following the sunrise\nA slow train, beckons like a drum\nAnd when you rise and listen to the song again\nThen you'll know, that the wings have come\n\nThere are wings, of the raven on the wind\nThere are wings, of the raven on the wind\nTugging at my lifeline\nCalling me again\n\nAnd when you rise and listen to the song again\nThen you'll know, that the wings have come\n\nThere are wings, of the raven on the wind\nThere are wings, of the raven on the wind\nThere are wings, of the raven on the wind\n\n",
