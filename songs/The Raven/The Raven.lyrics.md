Sunrise, colouring the highway
Your eyes, sleeping in the sun
And when you rise and listen to the song again
Then you'll know, that the wings have come

Dark wings, shadow on the highway
The wind sings, following the sun
And when you rise and listen to the song again
Then you'll know, that the wings have come

There are wings, of the raven on the wind
There are wings, of the raven on the wind
Tugging at my lifeline
Calling me again

A long rain, is following the sunrise
A slow train, beckons like a drum
And when you rise and listen to the song again
Then you'll know, that the wings have come

There are wings, of the raven on the wind
There are wings, of the raven on the wind
Tugging at my lifeline
Calling me again

And when you rise and listen to the song again
Then you'll know, that the wings have come

There are wings, of the raven on the wind
There are wings, of the raven on the wind
There are wings, of the raven on the wind
