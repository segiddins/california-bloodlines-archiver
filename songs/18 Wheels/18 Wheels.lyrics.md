See it shinning on the highway at night
Little lights burning from the cafe right
Fat Jack talking 'bout a girl named Rose 
Looking for something to put up her nose
But I ain't got time tonight, I ain't got time tonight

And if you want that flag to wave
Them eighteen wheels'll roll
Eighteen wheels gotta roll, road hugger
Them eighteen wheels'll roll and the wheels'll roll

Chevrolet burning in the left hand lane
Me I'm looking down through the window pain
A Beehive's laying with her head in his lap
I don't believe she was taking a nap
But I ain't got time tonight, I ain't got time tonight

Oh, if you want that flag to wave
Them eighteen wheels'll roll
Eighteen wheels gotta roll, road hugger
Them eighteen wheels'll roll and the wheels'll roll

An eight track's playing your "Silver Wings"
Like a razor's edge Merle Haggard sings
Earth bound ships on a four-lane sea
Don't look like there's any sleep for me
Cause I ain't got time tonight, I ain't got time tonight

And if you want that flag to wave
Them eighteen wheels'll roll
Eighteen wheels gotta roll, road hugger
Them eighteen wheels'll roll, and the wheels'll roll
