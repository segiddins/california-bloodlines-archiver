Hope you understand I've a long way to go
Hope you understand because I told you so
But, as the people say, I will be coming back this way
But, until then gal you're on your own

I'm not the kind of guy
For just a hangin' round
I'm bored to tears
With this old town
But, if you behave
Hey, I'll send you a card from Sante Fe
But, until then gal you're on your own

Hope you understand I've a long way to go
Hope you understand because I told you so
But, as the people say, I will be coming back this way
But, until then gal you're on your own

I'm gonna walk away
Don't ya come on along
I will be singing
A lonesome song
It's sad but true
But, I just gotta get away from you
But, until then gal you're on your own

Hope you understand I've a long way to go
Hope you understand because I told you so
But, as the people say, I will be coming back this way
But, until then gal you're on your own

I could never stay
Upon the shelf
Where the wind and rain
Are never felt
But, hey, don't cry, I'll be coming back by and by
But, until then gal you're on your own

Hope you understand I've a long way to go
Hope you understand because I told you so
But, as the people say, I will be coming back this way
But, until then gal you're on your own
