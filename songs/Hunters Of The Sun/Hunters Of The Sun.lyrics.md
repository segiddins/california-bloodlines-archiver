Oh, and so the story goes
That when the tribes first went to war
They were the sowers of the seed
And they were the hunters of the boar
Oh, and so they set the stage
But the play remains the same
Oh, they were hunters of the sun
They were catchers of the rain

Oh, and so the story goes
Oh, and once upon a time
There were Spanish quistadors
Down in the valley of the Mayan
And they came to take the gold
Oh, for Jesus and for Spain
And they were hunters of the sun
They were catchers of the rain
And they were hunters of the sun
They were catchers of the rain

Oh, and so the story goes
You just go and ask the eyes
That closed at Nagasaki
The day the fire took the skies
Still the bullies down the road
They are really all the same
They are the hunters of the sun
They are the catchers of the rain
They are the hunters of the sun
They are the catchers of the rain

Oh and so the story goes
When the flags all look the same
Oh, and all the tribes were gone
And no one knew their names
And they say once upon a time
Back when we were insane
When we were the hunters of the sun
And the catchers of the rain
And we were the hunters of the sun
We were the catchers of the rain

The hunters of the sun
The catchers of the rain
