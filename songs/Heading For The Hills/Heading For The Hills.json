    "Lyrics": "We’ll sing another song, then we’ve got to move along,\nFar away, my Sal, please try to understand why I’m leaving you so sad.\nLike the wind, we’re headed for the hills. \n\nIn 1776   men came from all of the thirteen colonies\nTo fight for General Washington,\nMany times  the only things they had in common were the songs they sang,\nAnd the cause for which they fought.\n\nWhen brother died at Bunker Hill, my mother said to me,\n\"Take your gun and join the men who fight for liberty,\nHere I sit awaitin’ for another British raid.\nI’ll drink my barley whiskey and pretend I’m not afraid.\"\n\nWe’ll sing another song, then we’ve got to move along,\nFar away, my Sal, please try to understand why I’m leaving you so sad,\nLike the wind, we’re headed for the hills.\n\nNo one ever told me where to call my home,\nWhen I was just a little lad I began to roam.\nThen I heard the musket fire ringin’ loud and clear,\nSaw the redcoats up near Tarrytown, well, I had to volunteer.\n\nWe’ll sing another song, then we’ve got to move along,\nFar away my Sal, please try to understand why I’m leaving you so sad,\nLike the wind, we’re headed for the hills.\n\nOnce I had a little gal, we lived outside of town,\nOnly had a one room shack and it was fallin’ down.\nBut the land was all our own, it’s where my son was born,\nLet’s hurry up and end this war, it’s time to plant my corn.\n\nWe’ll sing another song, then we’ve got to move along,\nFar away, my Sal, please try to understand why I’m leaving you so sad,\nLike the wind, we’re headed for the hills.\n\nWhen this war is over and our cause is won,\nAll men who seek equality will learn from what we’ve done.\nWe’ll send those redcoats packin’ to drink their bitter tea,\nAnd we will welcome all who share our longing to be free.\n\nWe’ll sing another song, then we’ve got to move along,\nFar away, my Sal, please try to understand why I’m leaving you so sad,\nLike the wind, we’re headed for the hills.\n\n",
