We’ll sing another song, then we’ve got to move along,
Far away, my Sal, please try to understand why I’m leaving you so sad.
Like the wind, we’re headed for the hills. 

In 1776   men came from all of the thirteen colonies
To fight for General Washington,
Many times  the only things they had in common were the songs they sang,
And the cause for which they fought.

When brother died at Bunker Hill, my mother said to me,
"Take your gun and join the men who fight for liberty,
Here I sit awaitin’ for another British raid.
I’ll drink my barley whiskey and pretend I’m not afraid."

We’ll sing another song, then we’ve got to move along,
Far away, my Sal, please try to understand why I’m leaving you so sad,
Like the wind, we’re headed for the hills.

No one ever told me where to call my home,
When I was just a little lad I began to roam.
Then I heard the musket fire ringin’ loud and clear,
Saw the redcoats up near Tarrytown, well, I had to volunteer.

We’ll sing another song, then we’ve got to move along,
Far away my Sal, please try to understand why I’m leaving you so sad,
Like the wind, we’re headed for the hills.

Once I had a little gal, we lived outside of town,
Only had a one room shack and it was fallin’ down.
But the land was all our own, it’s where my son was born,
Let’s hurry up and end this war, it’s time to plant my corn.

We’ll sing another song, then we’ve got to move along,
Far away, my Sal, please try to understand why I’m leaving you so sad,
Like the wind, we’re headed for the hills.

When this war is over and our cause is won,
All men who seek equality will learn from what we’ve done.
We’ll send those redcoats packin’ to drink their bitter tea,
And we will welcome all who share our longing to be free.

We’ll sing another song, then we’ve got to move along,
Far away, my Sal, please try to understand why I’m leaving you so sad,
Like the wind, we’re headed for the hills.
