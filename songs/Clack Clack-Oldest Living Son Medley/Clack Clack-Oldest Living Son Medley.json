    "Lyrics": "Dakota sky\nMade us feel like a river\nRunning free, running free\nAnd when I die\nBring the wheels that deliver\nRestless me, restless me\n\nLet me hear the clack, clack, clack\nAs the train goes rolling down the track\nTo carry me home\nBack where I belong\nLet me hear the clack, clack, clack\nAs the train goes rolling down the track\nTo carry me home\nBack where I belong\n\n\n\"In the town squares and the schoolyards of the heartland they found a strange common ground with the sleepless quest of this oldest living son.\"\n\n\nSycamores grow in the long planted rows\nOut there to break the April wind\nStill the dust it always blows\nIn our eyes and in our cloths\nAnd it's in our very souls\nLike this song about me and Jim\n\nThe back of my hand started looking like a man's\nWay back when I was only ten\nStill the lonesome in me cries\nLike a little boy sometimes\nYou can hear it scream\nWhen I come out screaming like the wind\n\nMe and Jim, getting thin\nFare-thee-well to him\nFare-thee-well now, Mamma\nI'm gonna take good care of him\nMe and Jim, getting thin\nOh fare-thee-well to him\nBut there ain't nowhere to run\nFor the oldest living son\n\nOur dad, he was a gentle man\nWhen we all worked at the store\nThe only time I ever saw him mad\nWas when he talked about the war\nWe lost a boy at Belleau Wood, and\nI guess he never really understood\nWhat the medals from the President were for\n\nMe and Jim, getting thin\nOh fare-thee-well to him\nFare-thee-well now, Mamma\nI'm gonna take good care of him\nMe and Jim, getting thin\nOh fare-thee-well to him\nBut there ain't nowhere to run\nFor the oldest living son\n\n",
