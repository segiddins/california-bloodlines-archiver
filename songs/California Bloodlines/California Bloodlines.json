    "Lyrics": "Had I been born in New York City\nA New York City girl I'd know\nWorkin' in the concrete, not the sunlight\nLivin' in the New York rain and snow\n\nOh, there's California Bloodlines in my heart\nAnd a California woman in my song\nOh, there's California Bloodlines in my heart\nAnd a California heartbeat in my soul\n\nAnd just to think I might have never known you\nIf I had lived my life in Tennessee\nBut I really could have never let that happen\nFor you and California are in me\n\nOh, there's California Bloodlines in my heart\nAnd a California woman in my song\nOh, there's California Bloodlines in my heart\nAnd a California heartbeat in my soul\n\nHave you wondered where we were before we were born\nRollin' 'round the heavens like a song\nI know it's then I saw the big Sierras\nSaw a California sunrise comin' on\n\nOh, there's California Bloodlines in my heart\nAnd a California woman in my song\nOh, there's California Bloodlines in my heart\nAnd a California heartbeat in my soul\n\nOh, there's California Bloodlines in my heart\nAnd a California woman in my song\nOh, there's California Bloodlines in my heart\nAnd a California heartbeat in my soul\n\n",
