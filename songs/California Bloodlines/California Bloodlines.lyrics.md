Had I been born in New York City
A New York City girl I'd know
Workin' in the concrete, not the sunlight
Livin' in the New York rain and snow

Oh, there's California Bloodlines in my heart
And a California woman in my song
Oh, there's California Bloodlines in my heart
And a California heartbeat in my soul

And just to think I might have never known you
If I had lived my life in Tennessee
But I really could have never let that happen
For you and California are in me

Oh, there's California Bloodlines in my heart
And a California woman in my song
Oh, there's California Bloodlines in my heart
And a California heartbeat in my soul

Have you wondered where we were before we were born
Rollin' 'round the heavens like a song
I know it's then I saw the big Sierras
Saw a California sunrise comin' on

Oh, there's California Bloodlines in my heart
And a California woman in my song
Oh, there's California Bloodlines in my heart
And a California heartbeat in my soul

Oh, there's California Bloodlines in my heart
And a California woman in my song
Oh, there's California Bloodlines in my heart
And a California heartbeat in my soul
