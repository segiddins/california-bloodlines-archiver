Well I used to find him reading
In the front room by the light
Until his eyes grew weary
And he'd close them for the night

But first he'd ask me questions
Who I'd seen and where I'd been
Was I running with the renegades
Looking for the wind?

And every story that he told me
Was carved upon his brow
And he colored them with language
That Mom would not allow

And then he'd whisper softly
With that sly and evil grin,
"Are you running with the renegades,
Looking for the wind?

Now his empty corner bedroom
Still stands behind the door
Where I had gone to see him
So many times before

But you don't have to ask me
Where's he gone or where he's been
He's running with the renegades
Looking for the wind....
