    "Lyrics": "Well I used to find him reading\nIn the front room by the light\nUntil his eyes grew weary\nAnd he'd close them for the night\n\nBut first he'd ask me questions\nWho I'd seen and where I'd been\nWas I running with the renegades\nLooking for the wind?\n\nAnd every story that he told me\nWas carved upon his brow\nAnd he colored them with language\nThat Mom would not allow\n\nAnd then he'd whisper softly\nWith that sly and evil grin,\n\"Are you running with the renegades,\nLooking for the wind?\n\nNow his empty corner bedroom\nStill stands behind the door\nWhere I had gone to see him\nSo many times before\n\nBut you don't have to ask me\nWhere's he gone or where he's been\nHe's running with the renegades\nLooking for the wind....\n\n",
