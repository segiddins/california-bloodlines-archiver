The dream still lives
In the heart of the kids
And the girls standing in the line
Who wait for the band
The guitar playing man
Who has them feeling alive for a time
And the dream lives on
In the wheels rolling on
America, you're running out of time
Where you gonna go
With the money running low
And you're just one guy standing in the line

Are you dreaming?
Are you dreaming?
Are you dreaming or crying in the storm?

Those who remain
In the shadow of the train
They wonder who's playing out the game
And where is the prize
That dances in your eyes
When you're playing for the money and the fame
And the dream lives on
In the rhythm of a song
America, you'll never be the same
And those with the dreams
All know what it means
It could be one light shining in the rain

Are you dreaming?
Are you dreaming?
Are you dreaming or crying in the storm?

Are you dreaming?
Are you dreaming?
Are you dreaming or crying in the storm?

Are you dreaming?
Are you dreaming?
Are you dreaming or crying in the storm?
