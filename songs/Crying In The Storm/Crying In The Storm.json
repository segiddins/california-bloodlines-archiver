    "Lyrics": "The dream still lives\nIn the heart of the kids\nAnd the girls standing in the line\nWho wait for the band\nThe guitar playing man\nWho has them feeling alive for a time\nAnd the dream lives on\nIn the wheels rolling on\nAmerica, you're running out of time\nWhere you gonna go\nWith the money running low\nAnd you're just one guy standing in the line\n\nAre you dreaming?\nAre you dreaming?\nAre you dreaming or crying in the storm?\n\nThose who remain\nIn the shadow of the train\nThey wonder who's playing out the game\nAnd where is the prize\nThat dances in your eyes\nWhen you're playing for the money and the fame\nAnd the dream lives on\nIn the rhythm of a song\nAmerica, you'll never be the same\nAnd those with the dreams\nAll know what it means\nIt could be one light shining in the rain\n\nAre you dreaming?\nAre you dreaming?\nAre you dreaming or crying in the storm?\n\nAre you dreaming?\nAre you dreaming?\nAre you dreaming or crying in the storm?\n\nAre you dreaming?\nAre you dreaming?\nAre you dreaming or crying in the storm?\n\n",
