C'mon down, Miranda, your window's open wide
Take a chance on a midnight dance, so I can see it in your eyes
C'mon down, Miranda, no need to fix your hair
Let's shake the town with the windows down
And fly in the midnight air
Fly in the midnight air

There are dreams that fly in the midnight wind
Souls that cry in the midnight wind
And lovers who try in the midnight wind
You and I, in the midnight wind

C'mon down Miranda, you know your time has come
You beauty queens come on so clean, but you're missing all the fun
Yeah, you're missing all the fun

There are dreams that fly in the midnight wind
Souls that cry in the midnight wind
And lovers who try in the midnight wind
You and I, in the midnight wind

There are dreams that fly in the midnight wind
Souls that cry in the midnight wind
And lovers who try in the midnight wind
You and I, in the midnight wind

C'mon down
C'mon down
C'mon down
C'mon down

There are dreams that fly in the midnight wind
Souls that cry in the midnight wind
And lovers who try in the midnight wind
You and I, in the midnight wind
