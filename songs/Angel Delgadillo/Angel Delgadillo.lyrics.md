I was talking to Angel
Angel Delgadillo
Angel Delgadillo
On the blue dream road
Angel Delgadillo
In Seligman Arizona
Seligman Arizona
On the blue dream road.

Angel he’s the barber there
Since 1950 cutting hair.
Angel Delgadillo
On the blue dream road.
On the wall the old clock ticks
Away the days on ‘66 in Seligman Arizona
And the blue dream road.

Angel played the saxophone
Juan and Lucy played their own
In Seligman Arizona
And the blue dream road.
They played "Moonlight Serenade"
And talked about the plans that they made
With Angel Delgadillo
On the blue dream road.

It’s a story as old as time
The road and people left behind
In Seligman Arizona
On the blue dream road.

From around the world they began to come
To find the road and one by one
Find Angel Delgadillo 
And the blue dream road.

Repeat Verse 3
