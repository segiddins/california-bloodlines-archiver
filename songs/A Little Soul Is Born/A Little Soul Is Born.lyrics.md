In the quiet of the dawn
A little soul is born
Put him in a blanket
To see that he is warm
And hold him very close
Just as closely as you can
For he'll never ever be
That little soul again

On a summer morning
There's a little boy at play
Discovering the world
That will be his one day
Watch him very close
Just as closely as you can
For he'll never ever be
That little boy again

For he'll never, ever be
That little boy again

On an autumn afternoon
A young man goes to learn
How to build the bridges
And make the wheels to turn
And woman, you will love him
Just as often as you can
For he'll never ever be
That young man again

Woman, you will love him
As often as you can
For he'll never ever be
That young man again

On a lonely midnight winter
An old man goes to sleep
Leaving everything he owned
For other men to keep
And the earth will hold him close
Just as closely as it can
For he'll never ever be
That old man again

The earth will hold him close
As closely as it can
For he'll never ever be
That old man again

Gone a life of yearning
A heart that's old and worn
And in the quiet of the dawn
A little soul is born
