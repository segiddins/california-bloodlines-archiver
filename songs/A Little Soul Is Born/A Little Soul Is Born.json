    "Lyrics": "In the quiet of the dawn\nA little soul is born\nPut him in a blanket\nTo see that he is warm\nAnd hold him very close\nJust as closely as you can\nFor he'll never ever be\nThat little soul again\n\nOn a summer morning\nThere's a little boy at play\nDiscovering the world\nThat will be his one day\nWatch him very close\nJust as closely as you can\nFor he'll never ever be\nThat little boy again\n\nFor he'll never, ever be\nThat little boy again\n\nOn an autumn afternoon\nA young man goes to learn\nHow to build the bridges\nAnd make the wheels to turn\nAnd woman, you will love him\nJust as often as you can\nFor he'll never ever be\nThat young man again\n\nWoman, you will love him\nAs often as you can\nFor he'll never ever be\nThat young man again\n\nOn a lonely midnight winter\nAn old man goes to sleep\nLeaving everything he owned\nFor other men to keep\nAnd the earth will hold him close\nJust as closely as it can\nFor he'll never ever be\nThat old man again\n\nThe earth will hold him close\nAs closely as it can\nFor he'll never ever be\nThat old man again\n\nGone a life of yearning\nA heart that's old and worn\nAnd in the quiet of the dawn\nA little soul is born\n\n",
