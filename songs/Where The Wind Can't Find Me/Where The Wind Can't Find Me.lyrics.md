Once my heart was many eagles,
Once my eyes saw many suns,
Once my ears heard distant thunder,
Once my voice was many guns.

Now I hide where the wind can´t find me,
Where the rain and sun can´t blind me,
And I watch out who´s behind me,
And hide where the wind can´t find me,  
Where the wind can´t find me.  

Once the road lay out before me,
Once my heart was full of songs,
Once the gold was there for taking,
Once the world was moving on.

And I hide where the wind can´t find me,
Where the rain and sun can´t blind me,
And I watch out who´s behind me,
And hide where the wind can´t find me,  
Where the wind can´t find me.

And I hide where the wind can´t find me,
Where the rain and sun can´t blind me,
And I watch out who´s behind me,
As I hide where the wind can´t find me,  
Where the wind can´t find me.  

Once my heart was many eagles,
Once my eyes saw many suns,
Once my ears heard distant thunder,
And once my voice was many guns.

Now I hide where the wind can´t find me,
Where the rain and sun can´t blind me,
And I watch out who´s behind me,
As I hide where the wind can´t find me,  
Where the wind can´t find me. 

And I hide where the wind can´t find me,
Where the rain and sun can´t blind me,
And I watch out who´s behind me,
As I hide where the wind can´t find me,  
Where the wind can´t find me.

hide where the wind can´t find me,
Where the rain and sun can´t blind me,
Watch out who´s behind me,
As I hide where the wind can´t find me,  
Where the wind can´t find me,  
Where the wind can´t find me,  
Where the wind can´t find me.
