The good ship sailed out of the harbour that day
Out of the town Monterey
She stood on the shoreline and silently prayed
Send him back home Monterey

Old Riley in the lighthouse had started to sing
"Stand at the wheel while you may"
The beads of her rosary went round on her rings
Send him back home Monterey

Before the wind
And the sun does him in
Ah, send him back home Monterey
And she prayed for the wind and the sailor that day
Monterey

Before the wind
And the sun does him in
Ah, send him back home Monterey
And she prayed for the wind and the sailor that day
Monterey
