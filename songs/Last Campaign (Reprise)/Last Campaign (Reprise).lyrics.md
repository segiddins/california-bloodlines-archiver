It was Bobby's song
That I wrote without trying
Every word, every word
Now that Bobby's gone
This is my way of crying
When I heard, when I heard

Listen to the clack, clack, clack
As the train goes rolling down the track
To carry him home
Back to where he belongs
Clack, clack, clack
As the train goes rolling down the track
To carry him home
Back where he belongs
