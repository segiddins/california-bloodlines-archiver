    "Lyrics": "And here I go\nRunning, reaching through the past\nI cut my heart upon some glass\nLying broken in the grass\n\nHe was a boy\nOn the North Dakota line\nReaching out for me through time\nHow his eyes were full of mine\n \nAnd as I leave Santa Barbara behind\nDakota roads, I will find\nAnd as I leave Santa Barbara behind\nDakota roads, please be kind\n\nWe had to move\nMama wanted to be free\nCalifornia seemed to me\nAs far as any place could be\n\nAnd all his poems\nThey are songs now of their own\nAnd the melody alone\nSings \"Are you ever coming home?\"\n\nAnd as I leave Santa Barbara behind\nDakota roads, I will find\nAnd as I leave Santa Barbara behind\nDakota roads, please be kind\n\n",
