And here I go
Running, reaching through the past
I cut my heart upon some glass
Lying broken in the grass

He was a boy
On the North Dakota line
Reaching out for me through time
How his eyes were full of mine
 
And as I leave Santa Barbara behind
Dakota roads, I will find
And as I leave Santa Barbara behind
Dakota roads, please be kind

We had to move
Mama wanted to be free
California seemed to me
As far as any place could be

And all his poems
They are songs now of their own
And the melody alone
Sings "Are you ever coming home?"

And as I leave Santa Barbara behind
Dakota roads, I will find
And as I leave Santa Barbara behind
Dakota roads, please be kind
