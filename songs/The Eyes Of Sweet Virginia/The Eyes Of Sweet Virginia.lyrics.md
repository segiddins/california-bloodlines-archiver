For the eyes of sweet Virginia were headlights on the road
A beacon for the weary heart that hardens as it goes
In the eyes of sweet Virginia, the fields of Kansas lay
And stretched to California, a hope for better days

Hang on dreams, you ain't seen it all
And I don't want much, I just want it all
And I will search forever, here among the stones
Oh, to find a girl who looks like home

And the one-night stands are the lost patrol, the taxi dancer days
And rock and roll's a sailor, in port for just a day
In the eyes of sweet Virginia was something I had lost
It's something how your life will fall, is to how the heart is tossed

Hang on dreams, you ain't seen it all
And I don't want much, I just want it all
And I will search forever, here among the stones
Oh, to find a girl who looks like home

For the eyes of sweet Virginia were headlights on the road
A beacon for the weary heart that hardens as it goes
In the eyes of sweet Virginia, the fields of Kansas lay
And stretched to California, a hope for better days

Hang on dreams, you ain't seen it all
And I don't want much, I just want it all
And I will search forever, here among the stones
Oh, to find a girl who looks like home

And I will search forever, here among the stones
Oh, to find a girl who looks like home
