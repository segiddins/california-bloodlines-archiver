Or you can play the song in G, but you hear C, too-
Capo 5th fret

I use the (Am7/G) more than regular (C) to maintain that 
dominant G bass line in the song.
If fingerpicking, stay near the top.  The D chords have 
that little trill from the 1st & 2nd strings, but through 
most of it the bass notes dominate.
