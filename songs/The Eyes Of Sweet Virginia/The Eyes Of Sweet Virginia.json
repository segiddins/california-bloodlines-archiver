    "Lyrics": "For the eyes of sweet Virginia were headlights on the road\nA beacon for the weary heart that hardens as it goes\nIn the eyes of sweet Virginia, the fields of Kansas lay\nAnd stretched to California, a hope for better days\n\nHang on dreams, you ain't seen it all\nAnd I don't want much, I just want it all\nAnd I will search forever, here among the stones\nOh, to find a girl who looks like home\n\nAnd the one-night stands are the lost patrol, the taxi dancer days\nAnd rock and roll's a sailor, in port for just a day\nIn the eyes of sweet Virginia was something I had lost\nIt's something how your life will fall, is to how the heart is tossed\n\nHang on dreams, you ain't seen it all\nAnd I don't want much, I just want it all\nAnd I will search forever, here among the stones\nOh, to find a girl who looks like home\n\nFor the eyes of sweet Virginia were headlights on the road\nA beacon for the weary heart that hardens as it goes\nIn the eyes of sweet Virginia, the fields of Kansas lay\nAnd stretched to California, a hope for better days\n\nHang on dreams, you ain't seen it all\nAnd I don't want much, I just want it all\nAnd I will search forever, here among the stones\nOh, to find a girl who looks like home\n\nAnd I will search forever, here among the stones\nOh, to find a girl who looks like home\n\n",
