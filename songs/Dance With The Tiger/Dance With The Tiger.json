    "Lyrics": "In every woman and man lies the seed of the fear\nOf just how alone are all who live here\nDenying the fear is the name of the game\nTo stare at the fear is going insane\nForgiving the fear is one up on Cain\nIs to dance with the tiger\nAnd laugh at the rain\n\nDon't give me your life, I have one of my own\nIt was a brilliant idea inventing the home\nCreatures of habit, American fools\nReaching for stars while we're standing on stools\nLetting it go is jumping the train\nIs to dance with the tiger\nLetting it go though we won't be the same\nIs to dance with the tiger\nLetting it go is the name of the game\nIs to dance with the tiger\nAnd laugh at the rain\n\n",
