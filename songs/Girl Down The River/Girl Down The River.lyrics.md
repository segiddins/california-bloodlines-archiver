Girl down the river, boy's on the run
You should forgive her, I was the one
And what could I give her, days in the sun
Girl down the river, boy's on the run

East coast girl and the west coast boys
Out for a summer in the sun
Her Daddy is a lawyer with a New York firm
And her Mother spends money like a gun
She started running with the good time boys
Wound up paying for her fun

Girl down the river, boy's on the run

Girl down the river, boy's on the run
You should forgive her, I was the one
And what could I give her, days in the sun
Girl down the river, boy's on the run

Girl down the river, boy's on the run

It got a little heavy in my sixty-two chevy
I told her I wasn't in the mood
Oh, I never take part or believe in breaking hearts
And I tell you there's only been a few
I had to slip away on the coast highway
It was the best thing I ever could have done

Girl down the river, boy's on the run

Girl down the river, boy's on the run
You should forgive her, I was the one
And what could I give her, day's in the sun
Girl down the river, boy's on the run
 
Girl down the river, boy's on the run
You should forgive her, I was the one
And what could I give her, day's in the sun
Girl down the river, boy's on the run
