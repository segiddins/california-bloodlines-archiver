    "Lyrics": "\"Where do we go from here\"\nCry the voices of the children\nIt was once so loud and clear\nIt was lightning in the field there\n\"And where do we go from here\"\nCry the voices of the children\nAnd burned into the time\nWe are the children\nThe children of the new frontier\n\nIn the Texas sun\nIt was 1963\nThat he held the hallowed gun\nAnd the Texas wind\nNow there's bullets in the curb stone\nWhere the dream had been\nThere the dream would end\nIt is clear\n\nYou hear the train\nAnd it's rolling past the farmyard now\nWith corporate names\nAnd you hear the train\nAnd it's echoing the voices\nThat were not the same\nHave we lost the game?\nThat is the fear\n\n\"Where do we go from here\"\nCry the voices of the children\nIt was once so loud and clear\nIt was lightning in the field there\n\"And where do we go from here\"\nCry the voices of the children\nAnd burned into the time\nWe are the children\nThe children of the new frontier\n\nAnd you hear the song\nThat they called 'Sierra Tango'\nWhen it played Haiphong\nAnd you hear the song\nAnd the nightmares of the boys\nWho went and stayed too long\nAnd their dreams go on\nAnd they are here\n\n\"Where do we go from here\"\nCry the voices of the children\nIt was once so loud and clear\nIt was lightning in the field there\n\"And where do we go from here\"\nCry the voices of the children\nAnd burned into the time\nWe are the children\nThe children of the new frontier\n\n",
