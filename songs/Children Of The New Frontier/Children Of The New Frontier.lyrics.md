"Where do we go from here"
Cry the voices of the children
It was once so loud and clear
It was lightning in the field there
"And where do we go from here"
Cry the voices of the children
And burned into the time
We are the children
The children of the new frontier

In the Texas sun
It was 1963
That he held the hallowed gun
And the Texas wind
Now there's bullets in the curb stone
Where the dream had been
There the dream would end
It is clear

You hear the train
And it's rolling past the farmyard now
With corporate names
And you hear the train
And it's echoing the voices
That were not the same
Have we lost the game?
That is the fear

"Where do we go from here"
Cry the voices of the children
It was once so loud and clear
It was lightning in the field there
"And where do we go from here"
Cry the voices of the children
And burned into the time
We are the children
The children of the new frontier

And you hear the song
That they called 'Sierra Tango'
When it played Haiphong
And you hear the song
And the nightmares of the boys
Who went and stayed too long
And their dreams go on
And they are here

"Where do we go from here"
Cry the voices of the children
It was once so loud and clear
It was lightning in the field there
"And where do we go from here"
Cry the voices of the children
And burned into the time
We are the children
The children of the new frontier
