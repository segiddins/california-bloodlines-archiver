    "Lyrics": "Hot desert highways and cadillac towns.\nA circus of cowboys and honky tonk clowns.\nEvangeline waits, from the window she stares.\nCool summer dresses are all that she wears.\n\nLoud neon jukebox a rustle of coins\nIn the jeans of pretenders \nThey are hard living boys.\nPlaying the song of those who have lost\nTheir hearts and their lives, it’s part of the cost.\n\nChorus:\nEvangeline waits\nIn the cool of the night.\nLike a caged nightingale\nDreaming of flight.\nEvangeline waits\nIn the cool of the night.\nLike a caged nightingale\nDreaming of flight.\n\nI stand by the highway and call out your name.\nIn any city or town my questions the same.\nHave you seen any angels, \nWho got lost in the wind.\nI’d give anything to see her again.\n\nIn Evangeline’s eyes are part of the clues,\nOf all we have lost and all I can lose.\nThe Angel of Mercy is nowhere defined,\nI search for salvation for Evangeline.\n\n(Repeat Chorus)\n\nOh Evangeline, how can I survive these times?\n\n",
