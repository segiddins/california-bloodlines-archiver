Hot desert highways and cadillac towns.
A circus of cowboys and honky tonk clowns.
Evangeline waits, from the window she stares.
Cool summer dresses are all that she wears.

Loud neon jukebox a rustle of coins
In the jeans of pretenders 
They are hard living boys.
Playing the song of those who have lost
Their hearts and their lives, it’s part of the cost.

Chorus:
Evangeline waits
In the cool of the night.
Like a caged nightingale
Dreaming of flight.
Evangeline waits
In the cool of the night.
Like a caged nightingale
Dreaming of flight.

I stand by the highway and call out your name.
In any city or town my questions the same.
Have you seen any angels, 
Who got lost in the wind.
I’d give anything to see her again.

In Evangeline’s eyes are part of the clues,
Of all we have lost and all I can lose.
The Angel of Mercy is nowhere defined,
I search for salvation for Evangeline.

(Repeat Chorus)

Oh Evangeline, how can I survive these times?
