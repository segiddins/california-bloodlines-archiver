Some to the rivers
And some to the seas
Some to the soil 
That our fathers made free
Then on to the stars
And the heavens for to see
This is the New Frontier
This is the New Frontier

Let the word go forth
From this day on
That a new generation has been born
Born to the task
To keep us free
Proud of the rights of the home country
This is the New Frontier
This is the New Frontier

Some to the rivers
And some to the seas
Some to the soil 
That our fathers made free
Then on to the stars
And the heavens for to see
This is the New Frontier
This is the New Frontier

And the day will come
Itâ€™s got to be
The day that we may never see
But man for man
And town for town
Will find the peace that shall resound
This is the New Frontier
This is the New Frontier

 Some to the rivers
And some to the seas
Some to the soil 
That our fathers made free
Then on to the stars
And the heavens for to see
This is the New Frontier
This is the New Frontier
