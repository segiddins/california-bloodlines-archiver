    "Lyrics": "She's as golden as the jewels of a Hollywood fool\nA highway out to the sun\nShe is somewhere to stand for a rock and roll man\nLiving his life on the run\nShe's as silver as the flight of a comet on the night\nA stairway out to the stars\nShe is heaven on the run who was captured by the sun\nA cool mist over my scars\nAnd she's oh, free and easy as the wind on the river to me\n\nMoonlight's alright, radio is all night\nSeems like heaven to me\nDown by the river taking all I can give her\nAnd I'm dancing in the eyes of the girl for me\nDancing in the eyes of the girl for me\n\nShe's as golden as the jewels of a Hollywood fool\nA highway out to the sun\nShe is somewhere to stand for a rock and roll man\nLiving his life on the run\nAnd she's oh, free and easy as the wind on the river to me\nShe's oh, free and easy as the wind on the river to me\n\nMoonlight's alright, radio is all night\nSeems like heaven to me\nDown by the river taking all I can give her\nLike the wind on the river she is home to me\nLike the wind on the river she is home to me\nLike the wind on the river she is home to me\nLike the wind on the river she is home to me\n\n",
