She's as golden as the jewels of a Hollywood fool
A highway out to the sun
She is somewhere to stand for a rock and roll man
Living his life on the run
She's as silver as the flight of a comet on the night
A stairway out to the stars
She is heaven on the run who was captured by the sun
A cool mist over my scars
And she's oh, free and easy as the wind on the river to me

Moonlight's alright, radio is all night
Seems like heaven to me
Down by the river taking all I can give her
And I'm dancing in the eyes of the girl for me
Dancing in the eyes of the girl for me

She's as golden as the jewels of a Hollywood fool
A highway out to the sun
She is somewhere to stand for a rock and roll man
Living his life on the run
And she's oh, free and easy as the wind on the river to me
She's oh, free and easy as the wind on the river to me

Moonlight's alright, radio is all night
Seems like heaven to me
Down by the river taking all I can give her
Like the wind on the river she is home to me
Like the wind on the river she is home to me
Like the wind on the river she is home to me
Like the wind on the river she is home to me
