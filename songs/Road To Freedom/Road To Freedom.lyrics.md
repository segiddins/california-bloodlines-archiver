I'm gonna walk that road
That we walked long before
Many years ago
And we’ll walk a hundred more

For we're coming one by one
You can see them two by two
Every time you turn around
There’s another one coming through
So we'll sing it long and proud
So everyone will know
That the road to freedom
Is a long, long, way to go

Turn and look out over there
Just as far as you can see
There are many more
Who would die for liberty

For we're coming one by one
You can see them two by two
Every time you turn around
There's another one coming through
So we'll sing it long and proud
So everyone will know
That the road to freedom
Is a long, long, way to go

I'm gonna walk that road
That we walked long before
Many years ago
And we'll walk a hundred more

For we're coming one by one
You can see them two by two
Every time you turn around
There's another one coming through
So we'll sing it long and proud
So everyone will know
That the road to freedom
Is a long, long, way to go
