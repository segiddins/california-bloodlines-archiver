I'm lost in the paradise, tasting the cream
That's falling like rain now in a moonlight dream
In a moonlight dream

In the beautiful cities with their cool Fahrenheit
And slow motion angels holding us tight
In a moonlight dream
In a moonlight dream
In a moonlight dream

In a bright Phoenix skyline were the boulevard queens
And the pale blue flamingo's in a moonlight dream
In a moonlight dream
In a moonlight dream
In a moonlight dream
