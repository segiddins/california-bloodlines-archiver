Stratacaster, Fender amps, Buick Skylark, summer camp
Philco decks and lava lamps, Stratacaster, Elvis stamps
Buddy Holly and aeroplanes, the Great Pretender and fleeting fame
Teddy Bears and what's-his-name, Chevrolets and painted flames

In the radio days
In the radio waves
In the radio craze
We were radio slaves

Perry Como finds a wheel, Elvis Presley he was real
Something that the girls could feel, something that the boys could steal
Peggy Sue and Brenda Lee, JFK and Wounded Knee
Atom bombs and Tasty Freeze, Cuban shirts and 'baby please'

In the radio days
In the radio waves
In the radio craze
We were radio slaves
We were radio slaves

Making out and secret sex, Rose parade and rubber necks
Fridgadares and bouncing checks, Beach Boys on the burning decks
Platinum blondes and dixie peach, pom-pom girls are out of reach
James Dean has defined our speech, endless bummers, Newport Beach

In the radio days
In the radio waves
In the radio craze
We were radio slaves
We were radio slaves

In the radio days
In the radio waves
In the radio craze
We were radio slaves
We were radio slaves

We were radio slaves
We were radio slaves
We were radio slaves
