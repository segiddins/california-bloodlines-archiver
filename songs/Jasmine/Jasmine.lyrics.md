And oh, here come those highways again
And oh, here I go
And oh, here comes I'll find you, my friend
Where roses in canyons
And night blooming jasmine still grow

And oh, here come those songs once again 
And oh, here I go
And oh, here comes that longing again
Where roses in canyons
And night blooming jasmine still grow

A long time ago
I found you, and so
I told you and oh
Here I go

And oh, here come those sidewalks again
And oh, here I go
And oh, here come those long walks, my friend
Where roses in canyons
And night blooming jasmine still grow

And oh, here come those highways again
And, oh, here I go
And oh, here comes I'll find you again 
Where roses in canyons and night blooming jasmine
Where roses in canyons and night blooming jasmine still grow
