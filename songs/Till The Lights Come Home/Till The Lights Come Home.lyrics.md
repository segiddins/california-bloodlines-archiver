Kenya knows, so does Montevideo
Let freedom roll, in the hills of old Montenegro
And they dance
And they dance
'Till the light comes home

Call the girls, call them up to the mountain
And tell the world, that even with blood in the fountain
We will dance
We will dance
'Till the night comes home

Kenya knows, so does Montevideo
Let freedom roll, in the hills of old Montenegro
And they dance
And they dance
'Till the light comes home

And they dance
And they dance
'Till the light comes home

And they dance
And they dance
'Till the light comes home
