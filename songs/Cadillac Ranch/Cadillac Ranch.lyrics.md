Cadillac Ranch
West of Amarillo
On the i-40 side
No way to miss it
For a Cadillac ride
Walk through the gate
And listen to the sound
Of ten ‘50 Cadillacs
Planted in the ground.

Out on route 66
There’s something going on
Something in the water
Something in the songs
"Lullaby of Birdland"
Rocking to the sound
Of ten ‘50 Cadillacs
Planted in the ground.

Chorus:
When you go to Texas
Give it a chance.
Take me back down to Cadillac Ranch
Kick off your shoes
If you know how to dance
Take me back down to Cadillac Ranch.

People gonna say
What does it mean?
A monument to the American Dream
It doesn’t mean a thing
If you don’t hear the sound.
Of ten ‘50 Cadillacs
Planted in the ground

You don’t need a reason
You just go as you are,
Go and write your name
On the Cadillac cars.
Johnny loves Lucy
Chu Chu was here
Love to leave my name
On an El Dorado’s rear
The winds gonna blow
Making the sound
Of ten ‘50 Cadillacs
Planted in the ground.

(Repeat Chorus)
