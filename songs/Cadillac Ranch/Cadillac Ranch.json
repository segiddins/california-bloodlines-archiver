    "Lyrics": "Cadillac Ranch\nWest of Amarillo\nOn the i-40 side\nNo way to miss it\nFor a Cadillac ride\nWalk through the gate\nAnd listen to the sound\nOf ten ‘50 Cadillacs\nPlanted in the ground.\n\nOut on route 66\nThere’s something going on\nSomething in the water\nSomething in the songs\n\"Lullaby of Birdland\"\nRocking to the sound\nOf ten ‘50 Cadillacs\nPlanted in the ground.\n\nChorus:\nWhen you go to Texas\nGive it a chance.\nTake me back down to Cadillac Ranch\nKick off your shoes\nIf you know how to dance\nTake me back down to Cadillac Ranch.\n\nPeople gonna say\nWhat does it mean?\nA monument to the American Dream\nIt doesn’t mean a thing\nIf you don’t hear the sound.\nOf ten ‘50 Cadillacs\nPlanted in the ground\n\nYou don’t need a reason\nYou just go as you are,\nGo and write your name\nOn the Cadillac cars.\nJohnny loves Lucy\nChu Chu was here\nLove to leave my name\nOn an El Dorado’s rear\nThe winds gonna blow\nMaking the sound\nOf ten ‘50 Cadillacs\nPlanted in the ground.\n\n(Repeat Chorus)\n\n",
