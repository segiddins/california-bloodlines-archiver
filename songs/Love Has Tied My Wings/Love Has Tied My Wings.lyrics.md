Oh, to be as free, as I dreamed that I'd be
Oh, câ€™est la vie, this is where I seem to be
Rooted in the home ground, seeing roads all around
Know how it sounds, honey, you and me
Ah but love has tied my wings
Love has tied my wings
Love has tied my wings

Where is the crime, to be free in your time
Dreams seem to be, all that is free
Rooted in the home ground, feeling love all around
Know how it sounds, honey, you and me
Ah but love has tied my wings
Love has tied my wings
Love has tied my wings

Rooted in the home ground, feeling love all around
Know how it sounds, honey, you and me
Ah but love has tied my wings
Love has tied my wings
Love has tied my wings
