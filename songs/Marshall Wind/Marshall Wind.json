    "Lyrics": "Sunday song, the day is long\nShe wore the yellow dress just to keep me happy\n'Till the day was done, out on highway one\nDancing off the bottle was the Sunday sun\nI'm singing, singing, singing a song\nWon't you sing along?\n\nSpeckled bird, without a word\nSings a little song that he thought he heard\nFrom the Marshall wind, where the sea begins\nWhen a bird wants a song he just looks within\nAnd he's singing, he's singing, singing a song\nWon't you sing along?\n\n",
