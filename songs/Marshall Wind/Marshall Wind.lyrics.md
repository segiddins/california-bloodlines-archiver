Sunday song, the day is long
She wore the yellow dress just to keep me happy
'Till the day was done, out on highway one
Dancing off the bottle was the Sunday sun
I'm singing, singing, singing a song
Won't you sing along?

Speckled bird, without a word
Sings a little song that he thought he heard
From the Marshall wind, where the sea begins
When a bird wants a song he just looks within
And he's singing, he's singing, singing a song
Won't you sing along?
