Driving north from San Roceedro, yeah, you keep looking for the man
Who was breathing down your collar yeah, since the border was at hand
And you're shoes are torn and ragged, you been running for so long
And your heart is Adelita but the highway is the song
It's a highway song

And you're looking for some odd jobs, yeah, you don't care how small
Back home in Encinita yeah, well, there was no work at all
And the people see you waiting but their eyes don't stay too long
On the dark and hungry strangers, yeah, that sing the highway song

I Vacarro for the highway song
I Vacarro for the highway
For the illegals are moving on
For illegals, yeah, oh, illegals are moving on

You got friends in San Clemente, yeah, you know a priest in East L.A.
Adelita's but a phone call yeah, but she seems so far away
And the power is dinero, but dinero is long gone
You sing homeland I'll return, for the highway is the song

I Vacarro for the highway song
I Vacarro for the highway
For the illegals are moving on
For illegals, yeah, oh, illegals are moving on

Moving on, moving on, moving on
For illegals, yeah, illegals moving on

On the highway, moving on
And the highway sign and the lights are fine and the highway whine
And there ain't no time for moving on
For illegals, for illegals are moving on

And goodbye to my Juan, goodbye Rosalita
Adios, mi amigos, Jesus and Maria
You won't have a name when you ride the big airplane
'Cause all they will call you will be deportee

Moving on, moving on, moving on
Take you home, take you home, take you home
Bring us home, bring us home, bring us home
