    "Lyrics": "Driving north from San Roceedro, yeah, you keep looking for the man\nWho was breathing down your collar yeah, since the border was at hand\nAnd you're shoes are torn and ragged, you been running for so long\nAnd your heart is Adelita but the highway is the song\nIt's a highway song\n\nAnd you're looking for some odd jobs, yeah, you don't care how small\nBack home in Encinita yeah, well, there was no work at all\nAnd the people see you waiting but their eyes don't stay too long\nOn the dark and hungry strangers, yeah, that sing the highway song\n\nI Vacarro for the highway song\nI Vacarro for the highway\nFor the illegals are moving on\nFor illegals, yeah, oh, illegals are moving on\n\nYou got friends in San Clemente, yeah, you know a priest in East L.A.\nAdelita's but a phone call yeah, but she seems so far away\nAnd the power is dinero, but dinero is long gone\nYou sing homeland I'll return, for the highway is the song\n\nI Vacarro for the highway song\nI Vacarro for the highway\nFor the illegals are moving on\nFor illegals, yeah, oh, illegals are moving on\n\nMoving on, moving on, moving on\nFor illegals, yeah, illegals moving on\n\nOn the highway, moving on\nAnd the highway sign and the lights are fine and the highway whine\nAnd there ain't no time for moving on\nFor illegals, for illegals are moving on\n\nAnd goodbye to my Juan, goodbye Rosalita\nAdios, mi amigos, Jesus and Maria\nYou won't have a name when you ride the big airplane\n'Cause all they will call you will be deportee\n\nMoving on, moving on, moving on\nTake you home, take you home, take you home\nBring us home, bring us home, bring us home\n\n",
