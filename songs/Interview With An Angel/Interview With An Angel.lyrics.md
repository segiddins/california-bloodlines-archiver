(Johnny)
Interview with an angel
Who’s off to catch a plane.
The tape machine is running
First I asked her name.
(Angel)
"You can call me Vegas
But it’s really all the same.
Do you have any questions
‘Cause I’m off to catch a plane"
(Johnny)
"What are all those stars 
Across the evening sky?"
(Angel)
"Those are all the tears.
You’ve never cried."
(Johnny)
"And all the grains of sand
Along the ocean beach?"
(Angle)
"Those are all the dreams
You could never reach."

Chorus:
 (Johnny and Angel)
Interview with an angel
Who’s off to catch a plane.
The tape machine was running.
Outside it was pouring rain.

(Johnny)
"Just how many women
can only one man have?"
(Angel)
"You can know a legion,
But there’s none that you can have.’
(Johnny)
"And why is there  just one moon
For all of us to see?’
(Angel)
"That’s the one true love,
And that’s all you’ll ever need.’

(Repeat Chorus)

(johnny)
"What then is the reason
That all of us are here?’
(Angel)
"I could tell to you the reason
But you’d never hear.’
(Johnny)
"What then is the answer?
Cause I really have to know"
(Angel)
"If you must know the answer
Then that’s the road that you must go.’

(Repeat Chorus)

(Johnny)
Then I said, ‘In closing,
Do you have any advice?’
(Angel)
"Yeah, lose the mustache
And try to be more nice."
(Johnny)
Then she was gone as quickly
As quickly as she came.
The tape machine was running
As Vegas caught her plane.

(Repeat Chorus)
