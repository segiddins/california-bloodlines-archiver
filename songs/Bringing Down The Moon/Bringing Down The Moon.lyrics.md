Just when you think you got it all
It's taken from your hands
And when you feel you'll never fall
You don't crash, you land on the floor
Still you're going' back for more
Only the dreamer understands

If I'm missing you, then soon
I'll be bringing down the moon
Turning midnight into noon to keep you here
If I'm missing you, then soon
I'll be bringing down the moon
Turning midnight into noon to keep you here

And when all the shadows fall
You're spirited away
And you say that you will call
Come some other day, and you're gone
But the memory lives on
Always a dreamer finds a way

If I'm missing you, then soon
I'll be bringing down the moon
Turning midnight into noon to keep you here
If I'm missing you, then soon
I'll be bringing down the moon
Turning midnight into noon to keep you here

Just when you think you got it all
It's taken from your hands
And when you feel you'll never fall
You don't crash, you land on the floor
Still you're going' back for more
Only the dreamer understands

If I'm missing you, then soon
I'll be bringing down the moon
Turning midnight into noon to keep you here
If I'm missing you, then soon
I'll be bringing down the moon
Turning midnight into noon to keep you here
