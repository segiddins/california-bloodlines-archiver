Medicine Man
You are wanted at the stand
Is there a doctor in the house
Who can lend a helping hand
Is there an angel in the sky
Who at least could try
To mend a broken spirit 
Who's forgotten how to fly

No one said it would be easy,
well one guy did, that's true
With a house in Colorado and one in Malibu 
He said don't let 'em get you down
With your face all in a frown
I know you've got the blues
There's a lot of that goin' round...

No one said it would be fair
With answers to your prayers
Oh I wish it was as easy 
as falling down the stairs
They say it is, so let it be
But lay something on me
To make me feel tomorrow
Is a place I'd like to be
