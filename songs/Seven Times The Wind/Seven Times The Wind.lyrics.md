She said "Hey Mister where you going?
I don't know, a good winds blowing
Your mama don't like me and my friends quit showing
I guess it's down to Mexico I'm going"

And I have tried yeah, a thousand times
To cross the T's yeah, to dot the I's
And I never do and I realise
Do you ever get out of this alive

And I said, "Seven times the wind
Oh, it can blow you down again
And seven times you rise
It's not enough in some people's eyes"

She said, "Hey Mister, where's the star
That shines on you no matter where you are?
It's a long dark sky that I've seen this far
Get more light from the highway tar"

You can only lose so long and then you say
I'm running out of other days
I've lived my life to hear their praise
It just don't seem to work out that way

So I said, "Seven times the wind
Oh, it can blow you down again
And seven times you rise
It's not enough in some people's eyes"

Seven times the wind
Oh, it can blow you down again
And seven times you rise
It's not enough in some people's eyes

Seven times the wind
Oh, it can blow you down again
And seven times you rise
It's not enough in some people's eyes
