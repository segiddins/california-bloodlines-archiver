If I had all the time in the world
And I had all the world in my time
There are dreams that I'm keeping inside
Like verses that never would rhyme.

I still dream I'll make movies in Spain
And photograph dancers in flight.
Watching the clock running down
And I live in available light.

And I still dream I will walk on the moon
If the moon isn't holding me down.
Chasing the future through fields
With moonlight igniting the ground.

All the young girls are light years away
And they seem to be browsing through time.
But you know that not one can compare
With the heart of this true love of mine.

In the water of all of my tears
The reflections of beautiful times.
In my arms I am holding the wings
Of angels I'm hoping to find.

And I still dream I will walk on the moon
If the moon isn't holding me down.
Chasing the future through fields
With moonlight igniting the ground.

Friends, who were here, now are gone.
Oh, why does it happen so soon.
And, as they were closing their eyes,
Did they dream they would walk on the moon?

And I still dream I will walk on the moon
If the moon isn't holding me down.
Chasing the future through fields
With moonlight igniting the ground.

And I still dream I will walk on the moon
If the moon isn't holding me down.
Chasing the future through fields
With moonlight igniting the ground.
