    "Lyrics": "If I had all the time in the world\nAnd I had all the world in my time\nThere are dreams that I'm keeping inside\nLike verses that never would rhyme.\n\nI still dream I'll make movies in Spain\nAnd photograph dancers in flight.\nWatching the clock running down\nAnd I live in available light.\n\nAnd I still dream I will walk on the moon\nIf the moon isn't holding me down.\nChasing the future through fields\nWith moonlight igniting the ground.\n\nAll the young girls are light years away\nAnd they seem to be browsing through time.\nBut you know that not one can compare\nWith the heart of this true love of mine.\n\nIn the water of all of my tears\nThe reflections of beautiful times.\nIn my arms I am holding the wings\nOf angels I'm hoping to find.\n\nAnd I still dream I will walk on the moon\nIf the moon isn't holding me down.\nChasing the future through fields\nWith moonlight igniting the ground.\n\nFriends, who were here, now are gone.\nOh, why does it happen so soon.\nAnd, as they were closing their eyes,\nDid they dream they would walk on the moon?\n\nAnd I still dream I will walk on the moon\nIf the moon isn't holding me down.\nChasing the future through fields\nWith moonlight igniting the ground.\n\nAnd I still dream I will walk on the moon\nIf the moon isn't holding me down.\nChasing the future through fields\nWith moonlight igniting the ground.\n\n",
