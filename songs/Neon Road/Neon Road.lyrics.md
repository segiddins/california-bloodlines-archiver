If you’re driving
On the highway
And you see
The stumble man.
You can stop and pick me up and
You can tell me who I am.
I’ve been searching for an answer
Like a runner I have said
I believe that I will find it
From the black top 
On this highway up ahead

Give me Airstreams
Give me highways
Show me the neon road
Give me Chi-Town
Give me St. Louis
Show me the highway home.
The highway home.

It was 1945
We were living through the war
In the words of Harry Truman
Give ‘em Hell then give ‘em more.
We had honour, we had promise,
We had dreams of better days
But somewhere in the short strokes
We got lost along the way.

Give me Fairlanes, give me top down
Show me the Neon Road
Give me Tulsa, give me Flagstaff
Show me the highway home.
The highway home.

I recall the days of summer
In my shining Chevrolet
In the orange groves of Pomona
Awkward moves and endless days
El Dorados sang "Moma Knockin"
We were rockin’ through the times
Down in Memphis they were talking
About a boy who crossed the line

Give me Airstreams, give me joy rides
Show me the Neon Road
Give me Kingman, give me Barstow
Show me the highway home.
Give me Fairlanes, give me tailfins
Show me the Neon Road
Give me Baghdad, give me Amboy
Show me the highway home
The highway home.
