    "Lyrics": "If you’re driving\nOn the highway\nAnd you see\nThe stumble man.\nYou can stop and pick me up and\nYou can tell me who I am.\nI’ve been searching for an answer\nLike a runner I have said\nI believe that I will find it\nFrom the black top \nOn this highway up ahead\n\nGive me Airstreams\nGive me highways\nShow me the neon road\nGive me Chi-Town\nGive me St. Louis\nShow me the highway home.\nThe highway home.\n\nIt was 1945\nWe were living through the war\nIn the words of Harry Truman\nGive ‘em Hell then give ‘em more.\nWe had honour, we had promise,\nWe had dreams of better days\nBut somewhere in the short strokes\nWe got lost along the way.\n\nGive me Fairlanes, give me top down\nShow me the Neon Road\nGive me Tulsa, give me Flagstaff\nShow me the highway home.\nThe highway home.\n\nI recall the days of summer\nIn my shining Chevrolet\nIn the orange groves of Pomona\nAwkward moves and endless days\nEl Dorados sang \"Moma Knockin\"\nWe were rockin’ through the times\nDown in Memphis they were talking\nAbout a boy who crossed the line\n\nGive me Airstreams, give me joy rides\nShow me the Neon Road\nGive me Kingman, give me Barstow\nShow me the highway home.\nGive me Fairlanes, give me tailfins\nShow me the Neon Road\nGive me Baghdad, give me Amboy\nShow me the highway home\nThe highway home.\n\n",
