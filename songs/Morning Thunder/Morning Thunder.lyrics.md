Naked in the sun, that's how she runs
Rocking my heart like the beat of a drum
Look at the sunlight, dance on her hair
Over and over, I stand there and stare
And I look at her run, naked in the sun
Oh, I look at her run, naked in the sun

Yes, it's morning thunder and it's my hunger
Making me feel like I'm ten years younger
Lay me away anytime night or day
Good god almighty I can't get away
I just look at her run, naked in the sun
Oh, I look at her run, naked in the sun

She's morning thunder and it's no wonder
I can't get my work done
I just look at her run, naked in the sun
Oh, I look at her run, naked in the sun

Still I heed the mustang creed
Whose days have known no rain
I used to run with the rising sun
When the nightmares call my name
Now I look at her run, naked in the sun
Oh, I look at her run, naked in the sun
Oh, I look at her run, naked in the sun
Oh, I look at her run, naked in the sun
