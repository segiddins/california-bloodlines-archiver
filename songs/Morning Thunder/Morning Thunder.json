    "Lyrics": "Naked in the sun, that's how she runs\nRocking my heart like the beat of a drum\nLook at the sunlight, dance on her hair\nOver and over, I stand there and stare\nAnd I look at her run, naked in the sun\nOh, I look at her run, naked in the sun\n\nYes, it's morning thunder and it's my hunger\nMaking me feel like I'm ten years younger\nLay me away anytime night or day\nGood god almighty I can't get away\nI just look at her run, naked in the sun\nOh, I look at her run, naked in the sun\n\nShe's morning thunder and it's no wonder\nI can't get my work done\nI just look at her run, naked in the sun\nOh, I look at her run, naked in the sun\n\nStill I heed the mustang creed\nWhose days have known no rain\nI used to run with the rising sun\nWhen the nightmares call my name\nNow I look at her run, naked in the sun\nOh, I look at her run, naked in the sun\nOh, I look at her run, naked in the sun\nOh, I look at her run, naked in the sun\n\n",
