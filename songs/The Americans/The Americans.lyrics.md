There are heroes on the streets of New York,
Heroes on the planes who won't come home.
Heroes all the guys who rode engine number nine,
The heroes that will never be known,
Heroes who will never be known.

And they were watching from the farms of Kansas,
Watching from the homes of Ohio,
Watching from the schools out on Second Avenue,
The heroes that will never be known,
Heroes that will never be known.

Here's to the Americans,
Born in the land of the brave and the free.
Here's to the Americans,
Sure they look a whole lot like you and me.
 
Don't they know who we are?
Don't they know who we've been?
In every city and farm,
All the women and men,
Who were born at the time of holding the line,
And we'll do it again and again.
 
And we are the Americans,
Born in the land of the brave and the free.
We are the Americans,
And we look a whole lot like you and me.

Oh, we are the Americans,
Born in the land of the brave and the free.
We are the Americans,
Sure we look a whole lot like you and me,
Sure we look a whole lot like you and me.
 
Oh, we are the Americansâ€¦
