    "Lyrics": "There are heroes on the streets of New York,\nHeroes on the planes who won't come home.\nHeroes all the guys who rode engine number nine,\nThe heroes that will never be known,\nHeroes who will never be known.\n\nAnd they were watching from the farms of Kansas,\nWatching from the homes of Ohio,\nWatching from the schools out on Second Avenue,\nThe heroes that will never be known,\nHeroes that will never be known.\n\nHere's to the Americans,\nBorn in the land of the brave and the free.\nHere's to the Americans,\nSure they look a whole lot like you and me.\n \nDon't they know who we are?\nDon't they know who we've been?\nIn every city and farm,\nAll the women and men,\nWho were born at the time of holding the line,\nAnd we'll do it again and again.\n \nAnd we are the Americans,\nBorn in the land of the brave and the free.\nWe are the Americans,\nAnd we look a whole lot like you and me.\n\nOh, we are the Americans,\nBorn in the land of the brave and the free.\nWe are the Americans,\nSure we look a whole lot like you and me,\nSure we look a whole lot like you and me.\n \nOh, we are the Americans…\n\n",
