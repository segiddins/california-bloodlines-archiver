Across cold water lies the sun
For now the journey has begun
The soldiers marching one by one
With golden light and silver drums
For the battle they have come

Oh, and out of the sun
Come angels with guns
Oh, and out of the sun
Come angels with guns
Angels with guns

And there is thunder in the east
Mark the time that the wind released
The birds of prey that shadow Spain
Who stand a witness to the rain
And there is movement in the west
For they are gathering the blessed
Speaking as one

Oh, and out of the sun
Come angels with guns
Oh, and out of the sun
Come angels with guns
Oh, and out of the sun
Come angels with guns
Oh, and out of the sun
Come angels with guns
Angels with guns

With one more second
One more minute
One more hour
One more day
We will find a way
We will find a way
Oh, we will find a way

Oh, and out of the sun
Oh, and out of the sun
Out of the sun
Oh, and out of the sun
Out of the sun
Out of the sun
Oh, and out of the sun
Out of the sun,

Angels fly in the July sky
Out of the sun
Angels fly in the July sky
Out of the sun
