    "Lyrics": "Let me take you to a timeless place\nWhere time has ceased it’s own cruel race\nWe could be as careless fools\nBeyond the sky, beyond the rules\n\nWhen those clocks no longer turn\nWhen there’s still no values burned\nPerfect lives like perfect pearls\nPerfect love in a timeless world\n\nIn a timeless world\nTimeless girl\nTimeless love \nIn a timeless world\nIn a timeless world\nTimeless girl\nTimeless love \nIn a timeless world\n\nTimeless dreams, timeless songs\nTimeless starts when the time is gone\nTimeless moon, timeless beach\nTime lives on within our reach\n\nLost in time and we could meet\nTime is young as the young can be\nTimeless we would never end\nTimeless girl, timeless muse\nTimeless man, in a timeless world\n\nTimeless world\nTimeless girl\nTimeless love\nIn a timeless world\nIn a timeless world\nTimeless girl\nTime is young in a timeless world\n\n",
