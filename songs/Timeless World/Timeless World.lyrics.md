Let me take you to a timeless place
Where time has ceased it’s own cruel race
We could be as careless fools
Beyond the sky, beyond the rules

When those clocks no longer turn
When there’s still no values burned
Perfect lives like perfect pearls
Perfect love in a timeless world

In a timeless world
Timeless girl
Timeless love 
In a timeless world
In a timeless world
Timeless girl
Timeless love 
In a timeless world

Timeless dreams, timeless songs
Timeless starts when the time is gone
Timeless moon, timeless beach
Time lives on within our reach

Lost in time and we could meet
Time is young as the young can be
Timeless we would never end
Timeless girl, timeless muse
Timeless man, in a timeless world

Timeless world
Timeless girl
Timeless love
In a timeless world
In a timeless world
Timeless girl
Time is young in a timeless world
