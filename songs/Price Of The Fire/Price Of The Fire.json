    "Lyrics": "After the flames\nWhen the fields are cold\nAnd after the pain\nWhen the heart is gold\nYou will find a brand new day\nWith the birds upon the wire\nAnd all you really had to pay\nWas the price of the fire\n\nAnd in our younger days\nYou could say we were wild\nIn our hungry ways\nThe safety lines were filed\nWe were running on the rims\nWe were burning out the tires\nAnd all we really had to pay\nWas the price of the fire\nOh, all we really had to pay\nWas the price of the fire\n\nAnd the breakers of hearts\nThey don't escape pain\nAnd you know when it starts\nAs you dive into the flames\nAnd there's a voice that tells you run\nBut you call the voice a liar\nFor all you really had to pay\nAll you really had to pay\nWas the price of the fire\nWas the price of the fire\n\n",
