You were the one who told me to go
West of the sun, Colorado
You said that I’d find, a good peace of mind
I believe that I’m getting it down
Hot on the trail of the clowns
Hot on the trail of the clowns

Dust on my feet, Hollywood streets
I’ve gone as far west as all of the rest
I can’t understand how they all got so tan
Doesn’t anyone work in this town?
Hot on the trail of the clowns
Hot on the trail of the clowns

You said that I’d find, a good peace of mind
I believe that I’m getting it down
Hot on the trail of the clowns
Hot on the trail of the clowns
