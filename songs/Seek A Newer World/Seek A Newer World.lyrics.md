Where have all the dreamers gone?
Out there sleeping in the sun
Where have all the dreamers gone?
When the battle's just begun

They will rise a thousand times
Echoing the words
Come my friends, it's not too late
To seek a newer world

Where did all the poets go?
Out there writing on the walls
How do all the poets know?
When the empire will fall

They will rise a thousand times
Echoing the words
Come my friends, it's not too late
To seek a newer world

Where did all the heroes go?
There were always here before
Where did all the heroes go?
They're standing just outside the door

They shall rise a thousand times
Echoing the words
Come my friends, it's not too late
To seek a newer world
Come my friends, it's not too late
To seek a newer world
To seek a newer world
