John Glenn is going to ride the lightning one more time, 
and we're all going to ride it with him, once again. 

Not just as one of the old guard out to redefine aging… 
but as a reluctant keeper of the flame from long ago and shining times…. 

He's going to climb that rocket one more time. 

A lost hero of the Heartland past, who came out of the fog of transparent heroes, and tacky headlines… 

To ride the lightning one more time. 

On the marshes of Cape Canaveral and Cocoa Beach 
Amidst the ghosts of Grissom, White, Chaffey, Shepherd, McAulliffe 
and all of the Challenger crew who rode the lightning one last time. 

He's going to climb aboard and buckle in.. 

Carrying the relics of the New Frontier and Camelot. 

Carrying the tiny withering flame of a time thirty six years ago when America felt young, 
as though there was nowhere we could not go 
nothing we couldn't do. 

On that day in February when we all stopped and watched Cronkite, Brinkley and Chancellor on black and white screens…. 
count down the last seconds as Johnny Glenn was to about to become the first American to orbit the Earth. 
High atop the volatile Atlas Rocket 
That had exploded in a wall of white hot flame so many times during disastrous launches . 

When he and Shepherd, Grissom and Carpenter were writing the text book 
Of how to fly that tiny tin can atop world's biggest fire cracker. 
We all watched and prayed when Glenn told Mission Control that a light inside his capsule said that his heat shield was loose causing he and Friendship 7 to burn up on reentry. 

As if it was predestination, the boy scout from Ohio safely parachuted Friendship 7 into the Pacific as if it were all from a paperback novel. 

It was a bright shining moment in a clear crystal time, 
when the shadows behind the legends were washed away by the light of a nations dreams. 

Johnny Glenn is going to ride the lightning one more time 

As the children and children's children of the New Frontier 
Watch Cronkite, Brokaw and Rather count it down. 
Count down the lift off that will hold the man, who probably has no interest of knowing that he may well hold the lost dreams of a fractured nation. 

A Nation who's heart had been broken by Vietnam, assassinations, scandals and leaders who have sold our future down the river for the fast buck and tainted power. 

People are coming from all over America, from all over the World and they really can't tell you why. 
As the people in Close Encounters of the Third Kind who kept drawing Devils Tower. 
They just want to be there and be a part of it all. 

To stand as a witness to the lift off that has become a pre millenium Resurrection for the tiny light that burned so deeply inside of us that we didn't know it was still there 

Johnny Glenn is going to ride the lightning one more time.. 

And in that moment of lift off.. 
We all might dare, perhaps for just a moment, 
To dream again of bright futures and newer worlds. 

Johnny Glenn is going to ride the lightning 

One more time.. 

And we're going to ride it with him 

One more time, 

Once again…
