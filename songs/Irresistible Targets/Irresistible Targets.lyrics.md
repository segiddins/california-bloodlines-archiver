Shoot out the moon in a midnight sky.
Shoot out the sun in a blackbird's eye.
Shoot out a dream and don't say why.
So it's up to you and I 
To beat our arms against the sky
And keep it flying.

Maria had a store on the boulevard.
For the barrio boys she worked real hard.
When the bullets fly in East LA
A bullet took her out today, out today.

Chorus:

Are they shooting down the Angels, yeah?
You can bet your life they are.
They're irresistible targets 
They're irresistible targets
They're irresistible targets
For any shooting star

1968 it has that ring
Of RFK - Martin Luther King
Where a dream went down
On a hotel floor
Dreams are what we're living for, living for.

(Repeat Chorus)

Shoot out the moon in a midnight sky.
Shoot out the sun in a blackbird's eye.
Shoot out a dream and don't say why.
So it's up to you and I 
To beat our arms against the sky
And to keep it flying.
Keep it flying.
