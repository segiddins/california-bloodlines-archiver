[Oh, you got to] (Jenny) hold the line and have faith in the river
Look for a sign any way you can go
For now is the time to stand and deliver
With the tears of the sun falling over the snow

And I have had a dream I would find the redeemer
And I have had a dream of the sword in the stone
And I swore to my heart that I would go on believing
'Till the tears of the sun were falling over the snow

[Oh, you got to] (Jenny) hold the line and have faith in the river
Look for a sign any way you can go
For now is the time to stand and deliver
With the tears of the sun falling over the snow
Over the snow

Then deep in your heart there's the song of the sailor
And deep in your heart there's a way that you can go
So find any star or the song of the Saviour
With the tears of the sun falling over the snow

[You got to] (Jenny) hold the line and have faith in the river
Look for a sign any way you can go
For now is the time to stand and deliver
With the tears of the sun falling over the snow
Over the snow
