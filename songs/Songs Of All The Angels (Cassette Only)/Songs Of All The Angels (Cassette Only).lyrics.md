Oh, find your own horizon, there's a way
Oh, find your own horizon, while you're on your way
So you won't be lonely as you go
May the songs of all the Angels sing within your soul
May the songs of all the Angels sing within your soul
May the stars of all the heavens come and shine
The lights of home

And heroes are for children, not for long
And heroes are for children, who sing the heroes songs
And you don't need the cheering it is so
If the songs of all the Angels sing within your soul
May the songs of all the Angels sing within your soul
May the stars of all the heavens come and shine
The lights of home

Oh, find your own horizon, there's a way
Oh, find your own horizon, while you're on your way
So you won't be lonely as you go
May the songs of all the Angels sing within your soul
May the songs of all the Angels sing within your soul
May the stars of all the heavens come and shine
The lights of home

May the songs of all the Angels sing within your soul
