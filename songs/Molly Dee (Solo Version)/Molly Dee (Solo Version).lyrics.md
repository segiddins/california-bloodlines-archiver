I got a gal in Tennessee
Sweetest little gal that you ever did see
She came along, one, two, three
She goes by the name of Molly Dee

Here we go, 'round again
Singing a song about Molly Dee
Far away, I know not where
She's the girl who waits for me.

Spending my money, gonna drink it away
I'll start saving on another day
She came along to rescue me
She goes by the name of Molly Dee

Here we go, 'round again
Singing a song about Molly Dee
Far away, I know not where
She's the girl who waits for me.
