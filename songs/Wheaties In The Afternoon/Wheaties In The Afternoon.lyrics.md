That misfit, ne'er do well
good for nothing, night person me...
That's the way I'm looked upon
by the vast majority

But I just make music
And I sing the midnight tune
Then I sleep away the mornings, 
And have Wheaties in the afternoon...

No bus stop, time clock
small talkin' mornings for me
It's that good time, red wine
sublime, midnight to three

But I just make music
And I sing the midnight tune
Then I sleep away the mornings
And have Wheaties in the afternoon

In that pre-dawn, half-gone
I sing all the songs once again
Mingle, and tingle, and single
and out with some old friends...

But I just make music
And I sing the midnight tune
Then I sleep away the mornings
And have Wheaties in the afternoon
