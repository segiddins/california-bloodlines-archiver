    "Lyrics": "That misfit, ne'er do well\ngood for nothing, night person me...\nThat's the way I'm looked upon\nby the vast majority\n\nBut I just make music\nAnd I sing the midnight tune\nThen I sleep away the mornings, \nAnd have Wheaties in the afternoon...\n\nNo bus stop, time clock\nsmall talkin' mornings for me\nIt's that good time, red wine\nsublime, midnight to three\n\nBut I just make music\nAnd I sing the midnight tune\nThen I sleep away the mornings\nAnd have Wheaties in the afternoon\n\nIn that pre-dawn, half-gone\nI sing all the songs once again\nMingle, and tingle, and single\nand out with some old friends...\n\nBut I just make music\nAnd I sing the midnight tune\nThen I sleep away the mornings\nAnd have Wheaties in the afternoon\n\n",
