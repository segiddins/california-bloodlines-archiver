In Los Angeles, California, twenty-two homeless families were evicted from
a vacant lot in the Skid Row District where they had constructed a
village of plywood shacks. The County came in and bulldozed their
houses, moving the families ten feet away to the sidewalk. Many of them
were children. They called their town, Justiceville.

Hey Mama, have you seen the dream?
Have you seen the highway where the El Dorados scream?
Hey Mama, have you seen the dream?

Hey Mama, did we have a light?
Did it shine in our front window in the middle of the darkest night?
Hey mama, did we have a light?
Yes we did and it's burning still

Justiceville, all they wanted was a home
Justiceville, a little shack to call their own
Where no one could throw stones
Justiceville, all they wanted was a home

Hey Mama, have you seen Crazy Joe?
I hear he talks to Angels, yeah, and folks that he don't know
Hey Mama, have you seen Crazy Joe?

Hey Mama, do we have a dream?
Will we have a home someday where we're always safe and clean?
Oh Mama, do we have a dream?
Yes we do and it's burning still

Justiceville, all they wanted was a home
Justiceville, a little shack to call their own
Where no one could throw stones
Justiceville, all they wanted was a home

Justiceville, all they wanted was a home
All they wanted was a home
All they wanted was a home
All they wanted was a home
