    "Lyrics": "In Los Angeles, California, twenty-two homeless families were evicted from\na vacant lot in the Skid Row District where they had constructed a\nvillage of plywood shacks. The County came in and bulldozed their\nhouses, moving the families ten feet away to the sidewalk. Many of them\nwere children. They called their town, Justiceville.\n\nHey Mama, have you seen the dream?\nHave you seen the highway where the El Dorados scream?\nHey Mama, have you seen the dream?\n\nHey Mama, did we have a light?\nDid it shine in our front window in the middle of the darkest night?\nHey mama, did we have a light?\nYes we did and it's burning still\n\nJusticeville, all they wanted was a home\nJusticeville, a little shack to call their own\nWhere no one could throw stones\nJusticeville, all they wanted was a home\n\nHey Mama, have you seen Crazy Joe?\nI hear he talks to Angels, yeah, and folks that he don't know\nHey Mama, have you seen Crazy Joe?\n\nHey Mama, do we have a dream?\nWill we have a home someday where we're always safe and clean?\nOh Mama, do we have a dream?\nYes we do and it's burning still\n\nJusticeville, all they wanted was a home\nJusticeville, a little shack to call their own\nWhere no one could throw stones\nJusticeville, all they wanted was a home\n\nJusticeville, all they wanted was a home\nAll they wanted was a home\nAll they wanted was a home\nAll they wanted was a home\n\n",
