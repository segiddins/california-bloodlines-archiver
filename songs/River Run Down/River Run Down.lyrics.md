Oh, the river run down
But, the stream ran dry
Big, strong man don't ever cry
Just stands to watch his love go by
Oh, the river run down
But, the stream ran dry

Yes, he loved a woman
But, he let her get away
Didn't ever think he'd regret that day
He'd laugh and he'd smile
He'd still play the game
But, he knew that day would never be the same

Oh, the river run down
But, the stream ran dry
Big, strong man don't ever cry
Just stands to watch his love go by
Oh, the river run down
But, the stream ran dry

There walks a man
He could've had a home
Fine baby children, a woman of his own
Walks all alone
He doesn't have a care
But, he keeps on thinking that he sees her everywhere

Oh, the river run down
But, the stream ran dry
Big, strong man don't ever cry
Just stands to watch his love go by
Oh, the river run down
But, the stream ran dry

Oh, the river run down
But, the stream ran dry
Big, strong man don't ever cry
Just stands to watch his love go by
Oh, the river run down
But, the stream ran dry

River run down
But, the stream ran dry
River run down
But, the stream ran dry
