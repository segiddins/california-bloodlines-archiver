"And across the plains of Witchita, at the farms being sold at auction, they
listened to the clear New England voice cut the clear Kansas sky." 

Time moves like a river
You can either sink or swim
And a wise man learns to forgive her
For all she's done to him
And no one's getting younger
And a few aren't getting old
It's all in what you feel
And not in what you're told

Oh you can't go back to Kansas
I was there just yesterday
Oh you can't go back to Kansas
It just up and blew away
Oh, but I will go on loving you
It's easier that way
But you can't go back to Kansas
'Cause that was yesterday

I see the sun rise and fall
I can feel the earth beneath my shoes
There's no need in you believing
That you were born and cursed to lose
So why not go on dreaming then
Yeah, take anyone you choose
There's nothing to be down about
'Cause you either win or lose

Oh, I can't go back to Kansas
I was there just yesterday
Oh, I can't go back to Kansas
It just up and blew away
So I will go on loving you
It's easier that way
But you can't go back to Kansas
'Cause that was yesterday
