Come gather the time
I have nothing to do
Come gather the time
I have nothing to do

Who could be nicer
Than someone with nothing to do
I've spent all my life
Looking for someone like you

Come gather the time
I have nothing to do
Come gather the time
I have nothing to do

Who could be wiser
Than someone who knows not at all
That's why I like you
Your face is as blank as the wall

Come gather the time
I have nothing to do
Come gather the time
I have nothing to do

If someone should say
I was born for a king
Or make me the president
If someone should say
I was born for a king
You'd still hear me sing

Come gather the time
I have nothing to do
Come gather the time
I have nothing to do

Go buy a blue bonnet
That's sold by the carnival man
You know he won't tell you
The colors come off on your hand

Come gather the time
I have nothing to do
Come gather the time
I have nothing to do

Come gather the time
I have nothing to do
Come gather the time
I have nothing to do

Come gather the time
I have nothing to do
