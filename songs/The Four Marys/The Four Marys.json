    "Lyrics": "Last night there were four Mary’s here\nTonight there’s just the three\nThere’s Mary Seton and Mary Eaton\nAnd Mary Carmichael and me\n\nWhen I first left my father’s side\nAnd pure as Easter rain\nAnd when I left my lover’s room\nI somehow felt the same\n\nWhen Mary left her lover’s side\nAs morning light had shown\nShe knew she bore the tiny child\nWho someday would be grown\n\nWe gave her then, our finest coats\nAnd carriage horse and reins\nWe held her once, and held her twice\nAnd held her once again\n\nAnd when the sisters looked inside\nAnd saw that she had gone\nWe all feigned sleep and closed our eyes\nAnd sang a silent song\n\nLast night there were four Mary’s here\nTonight there’s just the three\nThere’s Mary Seton and Mary Eaton\nAnd Mary Carmichael and me\n\n",
