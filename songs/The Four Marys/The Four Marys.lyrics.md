Last night there were four Mary’s here
Tonight there’s just the three
There’s Mary Seton and Mary Eaton
And Mary Carmichael and me

When I first left my father’s side
And pure as Easter rain
And when I left my lover’s room
I somehow felt the same

When Mary left her lover’s side
As morning light had shown
She knew she bore the tiny child
Who someday would be grown

We gave her then, our finest coats
And carriage horse and reins
We held her once, and held her twice
And held her once again

And when the sisters looked inside
And saw that she had gone
We all feigned sleep and closed our eyes
And sang a silent song

Last night there were four Mary’s here
Tonight there’s just the three
There’s Mary Seton and Mary Eaton
And Mary Carmichael and me
