Shady grove my little love
Shady grove I know
Shady grove my little love
Bound for shady grove

Well I went to see my shady grove
Standing by the door
Shoes and stockings in her hand
Little bare feet on the floor 

Shady grove my little love
Shady grove I know
Shady grove my little love
Bound for shady grove

Lips as red as a blooming rose
Eyes of the darkest brown
You are the darling of my heart
Stay till the sun goes down

Shady grove my little love
Shady grove I know
Shady grove my little love
Bound for shady grove
