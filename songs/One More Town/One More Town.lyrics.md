If there’s one more town, I’ll be going
A fight for the winning, I’ll be there
If there's one more song, oh, I’ll be singing
I’m always going, but I don’t know where
Keep a moving and I’m moving on
Keep a moving and I’m moving on

I spent seventeen years in West Virginia
Eight more years just running free
The girls back home in their blue gingham dresses
Only heard one thing to me

If there’s one more town, I’ll be going
A fight for the winning, I’ll be there
If there's one more song, oh, I’ll be singing
I’m always going, but I don’t know where
Keep a moving and I’m moving on
Keep a moving and I’m moving on

Went down to New Orleans last summer
On a flat boat working my way
There were well-mannered ladies and streets that were shady
But for me, I never could stay

If there’s one more town, I’ll be going
A fight for the winning, I’ll be there
If there's one more song, oh, I’ll be singing
I’m always going, but I don’t know where
Keep a moving and I’m moving on
Keep a moving and I’m moving on

I sailed up to New York on a schooner
Though I wouldn’t be staying there long
There were bright city lights and girls in pink tights
Their faces were all painted on

If there’s one more town, I’ll be going
A fight for the winning, I’ll be there
If there's one more song, oh, I’ll be singing
I’m always going, but I don’t know where
Keep a moving and I’m moving on
Keep a moving and I’m moving on
