    "Lyrics": "If there’s one more town, I’ll be going\nA fight for the winning, I’ll be there\nIf there's one more song, oh, I’ll be singing\nI’m always going, but I don’t know where\nKeep a moving and I’m moving on\nKeep a moving and I’m moving on\n\nI spent seventeen years in West Virginia\nEight more years just running free\nThe girls back home in their blue gingham dresses\nOnly heard one thing to me\n\nIf there’s one more town, I’ll be going\nA fight for the winning, I’ll be there\nIf there's one more song, oh, I’ll be singing\nI’m always going, but I don’t know where\nKeep a moving and I’m moving on\nKeep a moving and I’m moving on\n\nWent down to New Orleans last summer\nOn a flat boat working my way\nThere were well-mannered ladies and streets that were shady\nBut for me, I never could stay\n\nIf there’s one more town, I’ll be going\nA fight for the winning, I’ll be there\nIf there's one more song, oh, I’ll be singing\nI’m always going, but I don’t know where\nKeep a moving and I’m moving on\nKeep a moving and I’m moving on\n\nI sailed up to New York on a schooner\nThough I wouldn’t be staying there long\nThere were bright city lights and girls in pink tights\nTheir faces were all painted on\n\nIf there’s one more town, I’ll be going\nA fight for the winning, I’ll be there\nIf there's one more song, oh, I’ll be singing\nI’m always going, but I don’t know where\nKeep a moving and I’m moving on\nKeep a moving and I’m moving on\n\n",
