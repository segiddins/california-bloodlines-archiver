    "Lyrics": "They were travelers in the night\nThey're the ones who held the light\nAnd they whispered it's alright\nAnd the Promise came\n\nAnd there are those who rode the line\nThey're the keepers of the wine\nIt all happens in good time\nAnd the Promise rang\nThe Day the River Sang\n\nAnd the day I first found you\nThat's when I heard the clues\nAnd I knew that it was true\nWhen the Promise came\n\nAnd we stood beneath the trees\nWhere the Vision was to be\nAnd it was only you and me\nAnd the Promise came\nThe Day the River Sang\nThe Day the River Sang\n\nWe were blessed, we were bruised\nWe were taken by the news\nAnd oh oh oh\nWhen the Promise came\nThe Day the River Sang\nThe Day the River Sang\n\nAnd the day that the cripple stood\nBy the man who knew he would\nBut no one thought he could\nAnd the Promise rang\n\nAnd hearts can win the race\nJust show a little faith\nLike Mary full of Grace\nAnd the Promise came\nThe Day the River Sang\nThe Day the River Sang\n\nAnd you can almost touch the stars\nLike the moon in your back yard\nAnd we played our old guitars\nAnd the Promise rang\n\nAnd secrets kept within\nLike there's no way to win\nWhen did love become a sin\nAnd the Promise came\nThe Day the River Sang\nThe Day that the River Sang\n\nSend me the doctors' names\nWho really are to blame\nIf the junkies live in pain\nAnd the Promise rang\nThe Day the River Sang\nThe Day the River Sang\n\nAnd if we could all agree\nThat we should all be free\nIf we could let it be\nAnd the Promise came\nToday the River Sang\nThe Day the River Sang\nThe Day the River Sang\n\n\nAdditional verses in the album booklet\n\nWhen victory is ours\nWe're watching from the towers\nCounting down the hours\nTill the Promise rang\nThe Day the River Sang\n\nWhen women shared the rings\nTo sanctify the thing\nIt is love, love, love\nAnd the Promise rang\nThe Day Me River Sang\n\nWho's invited to the feast\nThey all will be increased\nAnd the women will be priests\nAs the Promise rang\nThe Day the River Sang\n\n",
