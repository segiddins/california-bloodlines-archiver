They were travelers in the night
They're the ones who held the light
And they whispered it's alright
And the Promise came

And there are those who rode the line
They're the keepers of the wine
It all happens in good time
And the Promise rang
The Day the River Sang

And the day I first found you
That's when I heard the clues
And I knew that it was true
When the Promise came

And we stood beneath the trees
Where the Vision was to be
And it was only you and me
And the Promise came
The Day the River Sang
The Day the River Sang

We were blessed, we were bruised
We were taken by the news
And oh oh oh
When the Promise came
The Day the River Sang
The Day the River Sang

And the day that the cripple stood
By the man who knew he would
But no one thought he could
And the Promise rang

And hearts can win the race
Just show a little faith
Like Mary full of Grace
And the Promise came
The Day the River Sang
The Day the River Sang

And you can almost touch the stars
Like the moon in your back yard
And we played our old guitars
And the Promise rang

And secrets kept within
Like there's no way to win
When did love become a sin
And the Promise came
The Day the River Sang
The Day that the River Sang

Send me the doctors' names
Who really are to blame
If the junkies live in pain
And the Promise rang
The Day the River Sang
The Day the River Sang

And if we could all agree
That we should all be free
If we could let it be
And the Promise came
Today the River Sang
The Day the River Sang
The Day the River Sang


Additional verses in the album booklet

When victory is ours
We're watching from the towers
Counting down the hours
Till the Promise rang
The Day the River Sang

When women shared the rings
To sanctify the thing
It is love, love, love
And the Promise rang
The Day Me River Sang

Who's invited to the feast
They all will be increased
And the women will be priests
As the Promise rang
The Day the River Sang
