    "Lyrics": "If you should remember me\nWhen all I am is a memory\nWould you keep a tiny spark\nBurning somewhere in your heart\n\nAnd looking back on all the years\nDays of laughter, nights of tears\nAnd if perhaps a bird appears\nIt will be me who found you here\n\nThe rain crow calls to the setting sun\nThe curtain falls on everyone\nAll my love was holy art\nThat I might live within your heart\n\nAnd if you should remember me\nWhen all I am is a memory\nWould you smile once and say\nI don’t believe you’ve gone away\nAnd would you keep a tiny spark\nBurning somewhere in your heart.\n\n",
