If you should remember me
When all I am is a memory
Would you keep a tiny spark
Burning somewhere in your heart

And looking back on all the years
Days of laughter, nights of tears
And if perhaps a bird appears
It will be me who found you here

The rain crow calls to the setting sun
The curtain falls on everyone
All my love was holy art
That I might live within your heart

And if you should remember me
When all I am is a memory
Would you smile once and say
I don’t believe you’ve gone away
And would you keep a tiny spark
Burning somewhere in your heart.
