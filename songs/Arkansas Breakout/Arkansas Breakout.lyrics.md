Arkansas, wind and straw
Keep on working hard
Arkansas, it killed your Pa
You found him in the yard

Arkansas, is it all
Work and drunk and dying?
Arkansas, there ain't no law
To keep a boy from flying

Leaving the fields
And the rain and the work and the pain
Like the wheels of a train
You must run, run, run
From the work and the rain

Arkansas, all I saw
On the way to freedom
All I saw in Arkansas
Was people bound for leaving

Leaving the fields
And the rain and the work and the pain
Like the wheels of a train
You must run, run, run
From the work and the rain

Leaving the fields
And the rain and the work and the pain
Like the wheels of a train
You must run, run, run
From the work and the rain
