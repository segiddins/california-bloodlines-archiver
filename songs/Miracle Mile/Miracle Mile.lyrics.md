Fandango on the boulevard,
You can count the cars
For I hear another cargo ship
Has just arrived from Mars
I'll take you to the blue light honey
You can wear your jeans
I'll Drink some Cuba Libres
And listen to your dreams

And we can watch the rich and famous
In their limos at the light
Leave a trail of marching dust
Across LA at night
And out there on the boulevard
The castaways go home
To find a place where they belong in the concrete and the chrome

Chorus:
They are lost for awhile,
Everybody's lost on the miracle mile

Molly's got her leathers on,
She hangs them on the floor.
I hear she has a charge account 
At the local bondage store.
Her boyfriend wears a mohawk
And plays in a local band
Who worship GG Allen
With self inflicted brands

(Repeat Chorus)

Life along the boulevard
There's nowhere left to go
We walk on stars from TV shows
That were canceled long ago
It is the ghost of Christmas past
Where believing still is real
I'll take you to the blue line honey
And we can remember how to feel

Out across the boulevard
Along the earthquake zone
The boulevard has faces
Wearing cheap cologne
Veronica is bleeding
She never had much style
She said there's nothing really 
happening
On the miracle mile.
(Repeat Chorus)
