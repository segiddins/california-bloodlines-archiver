    "Lyrics": "Fandango on the boulevard,\nYou can count the cars\nFor I hear another cargo ship\nHas just arrived from Mars\nI'll take you to the blue light honey\nYou can wear your jeans\nI'll Drink some Cuba Libres\nAnd listen to your dreams\n\nAnd we can watch the rich and famous\nIn their limos at the light\nLeave a trail of marching dust\nAcross LA at night\nAnd out there on the boulevard\nThe castaways go home\nTo find a place where they belong in the concrete and the chrome\n\nChorus:\nThey are lost for awhile,\nEverybody's lost on the miracle mile\n\nMolly's got her leathers on,\nShe hangs them on the floor.\nI hear she has a charge account \nAt the local bondage store.\nHer boyfriend wears a mohawk\nAnd plays in a local band\nWho worship GG Allen\nWith self inflicted brands\n\n(Repeat Chorus)\n\nLife along the boulevard\nThere's nowhere left to go\nWe walk on stars from TV shows\nThat were canceled long ago\nIt is the ghost of Christmas past\nWhere believing still is real\nI'll take you to the blue line honey\nAnd we can remember how to feel\n\nOut across the boulevard\nAlong the earthquake zone\nThe boulevard has faces\nWearing cheap cologne\nVeronica is bleeding\nShe never had much style\nShe said there's nothing really \nhappening\nOn the miracle mile.\n(Repeat Chorus)\n\n\n",
