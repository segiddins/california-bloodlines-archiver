Oh it’s time to tell the children
That it’s not about the war
It’s not about the winning,
It’s not about the score
It’s time to tell the children 
That it’s not about the rings 
That we put upon the fingers
Of the man who would be king

Oh it’s time to tell the children
That it’s not about the gold 
It’s not about the money 
Things that are bought and sold
It’s time to tell the children 
That they don’t mean a thing
Like the rings upon the fingers
Of the man who would be king

Oh it’s time to tell the children
That it’s not about the plan
To see who is the richest
Or the baddest in the land
It’s time to tell the children
That the birds upon the wing
They would never give their power
To the man who would be king
They would never give their power
To the man who would be king

Don’t you realize?
When you see the clues 
Right before your eyes 
On the evening news
Don’t you realize?
That the children know 
What the children see 
Is where the children go

Oh it’s time to tell the children
That it is about the heart 
That it is about the people 
Of this world we are a part
That it is about forgiving 
Those who stole the rings
To put upon the fingers
Of the man who would be king
