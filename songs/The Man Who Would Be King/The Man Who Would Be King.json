    "Lyrics": "Oh it’s time to tell the children\nThat it’s not about the war\nIt’s not about the winning,\nIt’s not about the score\nIt’s time to tell the children \nThat it’s not about the rings \nThat we put upon the fingers\nOf the man who would be king\n\nOh it’s time to tell the children\nThat it’s not about the gold \nIt’s not about the money \nThings that are bought and sold\nIt’s time to tell the children \nThat they don’t mean a thing\nLike the rings upon the fingers\nOf the man who would be king\n\nOh it’s time to tell the children\nThat it’s not about the plan\nTo see who is the richest\nOr the baddest in the land\nIt’s time to tell the children\nThat the birds upon the wing\nThey would never give their power\nTo the man who would be king\nThey would never give their power\nTo the man who would be king\n\nDon’t you realize?\nWhen you see the clues \nRight before your eyes \nOn the evening news\nDon’t you realize?\nThat the children know \nWhat the children see \nIs where the children go\n\nOh it’s time to tell the children\nThat it is about the heart \nThat it is about the people \nOf this world we are a part\nThat it is about forgiving \nThose who stole the rings\nTo put upon the fingers\nOf the man who would be king\n\n",
