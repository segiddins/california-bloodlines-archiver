I could go a runnin', jumpin'
Reachin' for the sky
If that's all that I thought
That it would take to buy your mind
Then one day
I looked the other way

And, hey, did you ever see my town at sundown
All the hills around
Hey, put your money away
Hey, hey, put your money away
Hey, hey, put your money away

When somebody comes a callin'
Knockin' on my door
Tryin' hard to sell me something
That I have no use for
I push the fool in this guy
I take a look outside

And, hey, did you ever see my town at sundown
All the hills around
Hey, put your money away
Hey, hey, put your money away
Hey, hey, put your money away

I could go a runnin', jumpin'
Reachin' for the sky
If that's all that I thought
That it would take to buy your mind
Then one day
I looked the other way

And, hey, did you ever see my town at sundown
All the hills around
Hey, put your money away
Hey, hey, put your money away
Hey, hey, put your money away
Hey, hey, put your money away
Hey, hey, put your money away
