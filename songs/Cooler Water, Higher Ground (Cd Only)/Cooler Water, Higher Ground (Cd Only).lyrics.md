Oh Lord will you send me a morning
'Cause I need a little sun on my wall
Often at night when the sun's going down
I feel like giving up on it all
Ah but rolling in the arms of my darling
Cooling her head with my hand
Oh a song comes to me when I'm dreaming
Like it's moving all over the land

It goes Mmmmmmmmmmmm
For here in my heart I have found
Mmmmmmmmmmmmmm
Cooler water, higher ground
Cooler water, higher ground

I was born in the heat of September
Died in the cool of the fall
Oh borning and dying, we do it all the time
And it don't mean much of nothing at all
Now there's no one looking over my shoulder
No one's putting nothing on me
You know sometimes I even believe it
And I know how it feels to be free

It's like Mmmmmmmmmmmm
For here in my heart I have found
Mmmmmmmmmmmmmm
Cooler water, higher ground
Cooler water, higher ground

And there are hymns in the whims of the lonely
And here in my heart I have found
Hymns in the whims of the lonely
And it's cooler water, higher ground
Cooler water, higher ground
