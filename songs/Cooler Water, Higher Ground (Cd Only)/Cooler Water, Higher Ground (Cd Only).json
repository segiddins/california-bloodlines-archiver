    "Lyrics": "Oh Lord will you send me a morning\n'Cause I need a little sun on my wall\nOften at night when the sun's going down\nI feel like giving up on it all\nAh but rolling in the arms of my darling\nCooling her head with my hand\nOh a song comes to me when I'm dreaming\nLike it's moving all over the land\n\nIt goes Mmmmmmmmmmmm\nFor here in my heart I have found\nMmmmmmmmmmmmmm\nCooler water, higher ground\nCooler water, higher ground\n\nI was born in the heat of September\nDied in the cool of the fall\nOh borning and dying, we do it all the time\nAnd it don't mean much of nothing at all\nNow there's no one looking over my shoulder\nNo one's putting nothing on me\nYou know sometimes I even believe it\nAnd I know how it feels to be free\n\nIt's like Mmmmmmmmmmmm\nFor here in my heart I have found\nMmmmmmmmmmmmmm\nCooler water, higher ground\nCooler water, higher ground\n\nAnd there are hymns in the whims of the lonely\nAnd here in my heart I have found\nHymns in the whims of the lonely\nAnd it's cooler water, higher ground\nCooler water, higher ground\n\n",
