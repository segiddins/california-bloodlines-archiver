    "Lyrics": "It's been a long, long journey down the river through the night\nIt's been a long, long journey, you were not in sight\nIt's been a long, long journey, now I want to touch the light\n\nMomentary madness that I should let you go\nMomentary madness to call and tell you so\nMomentary madness can be a lifetime, don't you know\n\nStill I'm a believer in the mystery train\nI am a receiver in the mark of Cain\nI am a believer in a grace of rain\nI am a believer in a grace of rain\n\nFaithless heart's a sailor, blowing in the sails\nBelieving he is moving as if the wind had failed\nFaithless heart's a sailor, blowing in the sails\n\nI'm a man without ritual, I'm a man without desire\nA man without ritual who's looking all the time\nStill a man without ritual is always out of line\n\nStill I'm a believer in the mystery train\nI am a receiver in the mark of Cain\nI am a believer in a grace of rain\nI am a believer in a grace of rain\n\nStill I'm a believer in the grace of rain\nI am a believer in a grace of rain\nI am a believer in a grace of rain\nI am a believer in a grace of rain\n\n",
