It's been a long, long journey down the river through the night
It's been a long, long journey, you were not in sight
It's been a long, long journey, now I want to touch the light

Momentary madness that I should let you go
Momentary madness to call and tell you so
Momentary madness can be a lifetime, don't you know

Still I'm a believer in the mystery train
I am a receiver in the mark of Cain
I am a believer in a grace of rain
I am a believer in a grace of rain

Faithless heart's a sailor, blowing in the sails
Believing he is moving as if the wind had failed
Faithless heart's a sailor, blowing in the sails

I'm a man without ritual, I'm a man without desire
A man without ritual who's looking all the time
Still a man without ritual is always out of line

Still I'm a believer in the mystery train
I am a receiver in the mark of Cain
I am a believer in a grace of rain
I am a believer in a grace of rain

Still I'm a believer in the grace of rain
I am a believer in a grace of rain
I am a believer in a grace of rain
I am a believer in a grace of rain
