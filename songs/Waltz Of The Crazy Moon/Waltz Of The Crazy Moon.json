    "Lyrics": "Diva morning and the new moon rising\nWho will take the silver spoon?\nHoney thighs on satin lying,\nIn the light of the crazy moon.\n\nOranges soaked in their own juices\nLicking lips of voices sung.\nMagic trips on velvet cruises\nSainted slaves of our own tongues.\n\nStrangers who meet by chance\nEyes across the room\nRemain the prisoners of the dance\nAnd the waltz of the crazy moon\n\nInner thighs and magic angels\nLooking out on Harvard Square\nPenny wise the pale white strangers\nWere the only faces there.\n\nLay me down in blond warm shadows\nSpeak to me of golden pond\nTorture me slow blue tangos\nEven when the thrill is gone.\n\nStrangers who meet by chance\nEyes across the room\nRemain the prisoners of the dance\nAnd the waltz of the crazy moon\n\nConnection made\nThe feel of shoulders\nThe smell of honey, salt and tears.\nBlinded by a flash of lightning,\nA moment or a million years.\n\nStrangers who meet by chance\nEyes across the room\nRemain the prisoners of the dance\nAnd the waltz of the crazy moon\n\n",
