Diva morning and the new moon rising
Who will take the silver spoon?
Honey thighs on satin lying,
In the light of the crazy moon.

Oranges soaked in their own juices
Licking lips of voices sung.
Magic trips on velvet cruises
Sainted slaves of our own tongues.

Strangers who meet by chance
Eyes across the room
Remain the prisoners of the dance
And the waltz of the crazy moon

Inner thighs and magic angels
Looking out on Harvard Square
Penny wise the pale white strangers
Were the only faces there.

Lay me down in blond warm shadows
Speak to me of golden pond
Torture me slow blue tangos
Even when the thrill is gone.

Strangers who meet by chance
Eyes across the room
Remain the prisoners of the dance
And the waltz of the crazy moon

Connection made
The feel of shoulders
The smell of honey, salt and tears.
Blinded by a flash of lightning,
A moment or a million years.

Strangers who meet by chance
Eyes across the room
Remain the prisoners of the dance
And the waltz of the crazy moon
