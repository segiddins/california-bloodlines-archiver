Lonely as the night time
As the day without a sunshine
As a kid without a good time
As a drunk without some bad wine
Keeping that in mind
You know I'm still in love with you

And hopeless as a snowflake
As a frozen pond and only one skate
A fisherman without bait
No gas station and you can't wait
Keeping that in mind
You know I'm still in love with you

And hope is like despair
It won't get you anywhere
And those days on Crows Landing
To me are like a branding
Keeping that in mind
You know I'm still in love with you

Empty as a tin can
A parade without a brass band
Dancer without a feather fan
A mayor without a grandstand
Keeping that in mind
You know I'm still in love with you
Keeping that in mind
You know I'm still in love with you
