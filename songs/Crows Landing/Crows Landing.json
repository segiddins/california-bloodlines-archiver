    "Lyrics": "Lonely as the night time\nAs the day without a sunshine\nAs a kid without a good time\nAs a drunk without some bad wine\nKeeping that in mind\nYou know I'm still in love with you\n\nAnd hopeless as a snowflake\nAs a frozen pond and only one skate\nA fisherman without bait\nNo gas station and you can't wait\nKeeping that in mind\nYou know I'm still in love with you\n\nAnd hope is like despair\nIt won't get you anywhere\nAnd those days on Crows Landing\nTo me are like a branding\nKeeping that in mind\nYou know I'm still in love with you\n\nEmpty as a tin can\nA parade without a brass band\nDancer without a feather fan\nA mayor without a grandstand\nKeeping that in mind\nYou know I'm still in love with you\nKeeping that in mind\nYou know I'm still in love with you\n\n",
