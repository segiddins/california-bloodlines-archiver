Day after day, what more can I say?
The river Louisianne seems to know a better way.
Rollin along when we are dead and gone,
The river keeps a-rolling like a never-ending song.

Roll, Louisianne, like a river on the land,
A river's just a river, never tried to understand.
Roll, Louisianne, like a river on the land,
If loving you is all I do, it´s everywhere I am,
Louisianne.        

The rain and the wind, standing by a friend,
The world may be a curse, or you will make the world your friend.
Day after day, what more can I say?
The river Louisianne just seems to know a better way.

Roll Louisianne, like a river on the land,
A river's just a river, never tried to understand.
Roll, Louisianne, like a river on the land,
If loving you is all I do, you're everywhere I am,
Louisianne.        
       

Roll, Louisianne, like a river on the land,
A river's just a river, never tried to understand.
Roll, Louisianne, like a river on the land.
If loving you is all I do, it´s everywhere I am, 
Louisianne.
