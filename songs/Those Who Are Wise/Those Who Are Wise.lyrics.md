I used to sit in the shade
Of an old cedar tree
And I dream of the days
What they’re holding for me

And all those who know
Who gaze at the sky
It’s for those who are wise
Only those who are wise
It’s for those who are wise
Only those who are wise

And the west winds would blow
They’d be singing to me
They’d say look you out yonder
Just as far as you can see

And all those who know
Who gaze at the sky
It’s for those who are wise
Only those who are wise
It’s for those who are wise
Only those who are wise

And the years went their way
As the good years will go
But my dreams linger on
In the hills of my home

And the young men should know
Who gaze at the sky
It is you who are wise
Only you who are wise
It is you who are wise
Only you who are wise
