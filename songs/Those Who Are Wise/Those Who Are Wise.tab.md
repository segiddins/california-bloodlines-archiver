D (Bass run: DD FD CD ö repeated throughout)
I used to sit in the (Em)shade   (A7)
Of an (Em7)old cedar (D)tree,
And I dream of the (Em)days  (A7)
What theyâre (Em7)holding for (D)me.

And (G)all those who (A7)know,
Who (D)gaze at the (Bm)sky, 
Itâs for (D)those who are (Em)wise,  (A7)
Only (Em7)those who are (D)wise.
Itâs for those who are (Em)wise,  (A7)
Only (Em7)hose who are (D)wise.

And the west winds would (Em)blow,  (A7)
Theyâd be (Em7)calling to (D)me.
Theyâd say look you out (Em)yonder,  (A7)
Just as (Em7)far as you can (D)see.

And (G)all those who (A7)know,
Who (D)gaze at the (Bm)sky,
Itâs for (D)those who are (Em)wise,  (A7)
Only (Em7)those who are (D)wise.
And itâs for those who are (Em)wise,  (A7)
Only (Em7)those who are (D)wise.

And the years went their (Em)way,  (A7)
As the (Em7)good years will (D)go,
And my dreams lingered (Em)on  (A7)
In the (Em7) hills of my (D)home.

And the (G)young men should (A7)know
Who (D)gaze at the (Bm)sky·
It is (D)you who are (Em)wise, (A7)
Only (Em7)you who are (D)wise.
It is you who are (Em)wise, (A7)
Only (Em)you who are (D)wise.
