Oh there's a story, told on the coastline
About a star-eyed girl and her man of the sea
He was a whaler, assassin of the sea wind
And she told him, "Oh, let the whale go free"

And for the glory, they sailed with the sunrise
He was the devil on the wind out of Monterey
She pleaded, "Keeper of my heartline"
She pleaded, "Oh, let the whale go free"

And she's waiting, and she's praying
And she's waiting, and she's praying
Odin, spirit of the water
Odin, god of the sea
Odin, spirit of the water
Odin, oh, let the whale go free

And then one dark day in February, say
On the twenty-eighth, maybe the ninth
You know, the ship sailed in with nary a man
On the deck there to hold the line
And then, lashed to the mast like a ghost from the past
Was the man who had christened the crime
He said, "The battle is done and the whale has won
It's the last time I'm taking the line"

And she's waiting, and she's praying
And she's waiting, and she's praying
Odin, spirit of the water
Odin, god of the sea
Odin, spirit of the water
Odin, oh, let the whale go free

Odin, spirit of the water
Odin, god of the sea
Odin, spirit of the water
Odin, oh, let the whale go free
