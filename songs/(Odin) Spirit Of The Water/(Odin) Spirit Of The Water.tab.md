(Am)
Oh, there's a story, (Em7) (F) (Em)told on the (Am)coastline, (Em7) (F) (Em)
About a (Am)star-eyed (Em7)girl (F) and her (Em)man of the (Am)sea. (Em7) (F) (Em)
He was a (Am)whaler, (Em7) (F) ass(Em)assin of the (Am)sea wind, (Em7) (F) (Em)
She (Am)told him,(Em7) (F) "Oh, let the (Em)whale go (Am)free." (Em7) (F) (Em)
(Am) (Em7) (F) (Em)

And for the (Am)glory,(Em7) (F)  they (Em)sailed with the (Am)sunrise, (Em7) (F) (Em)
He was the (Am)devil on the (Em7)wind (F) out of (Em)Monter(Am)ey. (Em7) (F) (Em)
And she (Am)pleaded, (Em7) (F) (Em)"Keeper of my (Am)heartline," (Em7) (F) (Em)
She (Am)pleaded, (Em7) (F)  "Oh, let the (Em)whale go (Am)free." (Em7) (F) (Em)
(Am) (Em7) (F) (Em)

She's (Am)waiting, (Em7) (F) (Em) she's (Am)praying, (Em7) (F) (Em)
And she's (Am)waiting, (Em7) (F) (Em) and she's (Am)praying, (Em7) (F) (Em)
(Am)Odin,(Em7) (F) (Em)spirit of the (Am)water, (Em7) (F) (Em)
(Am)Odin, (Em7) (F) (Em)god of the (Am)sea, (Em7) (F) (Em)
(Am)Odin,(Em7) (F) (Em)spirit of the (Am)water, (Em7) (F) (Em)
(Am)Odin,(Em7) (F) oh, let the (Em)whale go (Am)free.
(Em7) (F) (Em) (Am) (Em7) (F) (Em) (Am) (Em7) (F) (Em) (Am) (Em7) (F) (Em)

And then (Am)(let chord ring) one dark day in February, 
Say on the (Am)(let chord ring) twenty-eighth, maybe the ninth,
You know, the (Am)(let chord ring) ship sailed in with nary a man
On the (Am)(let chord ring) deck there to hold the line,
And then, (Am)lashed to the (Em7)mast like a (F)ghost from the (Em)past,
Was the (Am)man who had (Em7)christened the (F)crime. (Em)
He said, "The (Am)battle is (Em7)done and the (F)whale has (Em)won,
It's the (Am)last time I'm (Em7)taking the (F)line." (Em)

And she's (Am)waiting, (Em7) (F) (Em) and she's (Am)praying, (Em7) (F) (Em)
And she's (Am)waiting, (Em7) (F) (Em) and she's (Am)praying, (Em7) (F) (Em)
(Am)Odin,(Em7) (F) (Em)spirit of the (Am)water, (Em7) (F) (Em)
(Am)Odin, (Em7) (F) (Em)god of the (Am)sea, (Em7) (F) (Em)
(Am)Odin,(Em7) (F) (Em)spirit of the (Am)water, (Em7) (F) (Em)
(Am)Odin,(Em7) (F) oh, let the (Em)whale go (Am)free. (Em7) (F) (Em)

(Am)Odin,(Em7) (F) (Em)spirit of the (Am)water, (Em7) (F) (Em)
(Am)Odin, (Em7) (F) he was the (Em)god of the (Am)sea, (Em7) (F) (Em)
(Am)Odin,(Em7) (F) (Em)spirit of the (Am)water, (Em7) (F) (Em)
(Am)Odin,(Em7) (F) oh, let the (Em)whale go (Am)free.
(Em7) (F) (Em) (Am) (Em7) (F) (Em) (Am) (Em7) (F) (Em) (Am)
(and fade with bg singers repeating "Let the whale go free")
