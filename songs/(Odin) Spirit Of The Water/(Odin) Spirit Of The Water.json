    "Lyrics": "Oh there's a story, told on the coastline\nAbout a star-eyed girl and her man of the sea\nHe was a whaler, assassin of the sea wind\nAnd she told him, \"Oh, let the whale go free\"\n\nAnd for the glory, they sailed with the sunrise\nHe was the devil on the wind out of Monterey\nShe pleaded, \"Keeper of my heartline\"\nShe pleaded, \"Oh, let the whale go free\"\n\nAnd she's waiting, and she's praying\nAnd she's waiting, and she's praying\nOdin, spirit of the water\nOdin, god of the sea\nOdin, spirit of the water\nOdin, oh, let the whale go free\n\nAnd then one dark day in February, say\nOn the twenty-eighth, maybe the ninth\nYou know, the ship sailed in with nary a man\nOn the deck there to hold the line\nAnd then, lashed to the mast like a ghost from the past\nWas the man who had christened the crime\nHe said, \"The battle is done and the whale has won\nIt's the last time I'm taking the line\"\n\nAnd she's waiting, and she's praying\nAnd she's waiting, and she's praying\nOdin, spirit of the water\nOdin, god of the sea\nOdin, spirit of the water\nOdin, oh, let the whale go free\n\nOdin, spirit of the water\nOdin, god of the sea\nOdin, spirit of the water\nOdin, oh, let the whale go free\n\n",
