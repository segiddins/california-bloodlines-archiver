Clarence Mulloy, stands in his bedroom and stares
He is going away
Clarence Mulloy, stands at the mirror and shaves
Today is the day
Oh it had to come sooner or later
That the letter of greeting would say
"Clarence my boy, you are draft age today"

Clarence Mulloy, looks at his shelves and his soldiers
Made out of clay
Clarence Mulloy, looks at his Ma and they know
There is nothing to say
Boarding the bus on the corner
Every face on the street seemed to say
"Clarence my boy, you are draft age today"

And the boy's have all gone to Balboa
With some girls that they met on the way
And Alexis stayed home like you told her
Clarence Mulloy, you are draft age today

Clarence Mulloy, looks out the window and sees
What is passing him by
Clarence Mulloy, how incredibly short it can be
It is making you cry
And the dirty small boy that has seen you
Looks up from his baseball to say
"Clarence Mulloy, you are draft age today"

And the boy's have all gone to Balboa
With some girls that they met on the way
And Alexis stayed home like you told her
Clarence Mulloy, you are draft age today

Clarence Mulloy, you are draft age today
Clarence Mulloy, you are draft age today
