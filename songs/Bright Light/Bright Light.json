    "Lyrics": "There's a bright light on the water\nThere's a bright light on the sea\nThere's a bright light, shining in the night\nShining for the people who are waiting\nWaiting to be free\n \nOh the road is hard, and the road is long\nAnd it seems as though we're singing sadder songs\nBut the long darkest night, is followed by the light\nIt keeps on a-shining don't you know....\n \nThere's a bright light on the water\nThere's a bright light on the sea\nThere's a bright light, shining in the night\nShining for the people who are waiting\nWaiting to be free....\n \nOh the rain will fall, so the grass will grow\nAnd I ain't sayin' nothing you don't know\nSo we keep on pushing on, till we find ourselves a song\nAs the children lead the westward people home...\n \nThere's a bright light on the water\nThere's a bright light on the sea\nThere's a bright light, shining in the night\nShining for the people who are waiting...\nWaiting to be free\n\n",
