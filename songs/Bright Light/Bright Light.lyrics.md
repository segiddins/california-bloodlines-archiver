There's a bright light on the water
There's a bright light on the sea
There's a bright light, shining in the night
Shining for the people who are waiting
Waiting to be free
 
Oh the road is hard, and the road is long
And it seems as though we're singing sadder songs
But the long darkest night, is followed by the light
It keeps on a-shining don't you know....
 
There's a bright light on the water
There's a bright light on the sea
There's a bright light, shining in the night
Shining for the people who are waiting
Waiting to be free....
 
Oh the rain will fall, so the grass will grow
And I ain't sayin' nothing you don't know
So we keep on pushing on, till we find ourselves a song
As the children lead the westward people home...
 
There's a bright light on the water
There's a bright light on the sea
There's a bright light, shining in the night
Shining for the people who are waiting...
Waiting to be free
