    "Lyrics": "Southern born folks in LA, another quake hit today\nAnd I sit here watching CNN, a thousand miles away\nAs the world goes rolling along\nAs the world goes rolling like a log\nAs the world goes rolling, mmmhummm\nShaking off people like fleas off the back of a dog\n\nBlowing away in the Philippines, dumped some ash on the lawn\nBuried deep in the burp of the earth, as the world goes rolling along\nAs the world goes rolling along\nAs the world goes rolling like a log\nAs the world goes rolling, mmmhummm\nShaking off people like fleas off the back of a dog\n\nBlack cloud hanging over Kansas, a funnel touched down in Wichita\nThe trailer park people are running for their lives\nYou don't need a reason 'cause God is the law\nAnd the world goes rolling along\nAs the world goes rolling like a log\nAnd the world goes rolling, mmmhummm\nShaking off people like fleas off the back of a dog\n\nGo ahead and dig our shelters, go ahead and build our dams\nBut when good Mother Earth starts lifting her skirts\nI'm gonna pray for mercy no matter where I am\nWhen the world goes rolling along\nAnd the world goes rolling like a log\nThe world goes rolling, mmmhummm\nShaking off people like fleas off the back of a dog\n\n",
