Southern born folks in LA, another quake hit today
And I sit here watching CNN, a thousand miles away
As the world goes rolling along
As the world goes rolling like a log
As the world goes rolling, mmmhummm
Shaking off people like fleas off the back of a dog

Blowing away in the Philippines, dumped some ash on the lawn
Buried deep in the burp of the earth, as the world goes rolling along
As the world goes rolling along
As the world goes rolling like a log
As the world goes rolling, mmmhummm
Shaking off people like fleas off the back of a dog

Black cloud hanging over Kansas, a funnel touched down in Wichita
The trailer park people are running for their lives
You don't need a reason 'cause God is the law
And the world goes rolling along
As the world goes rolling like a log
And the world goes rolling, mmmhummm
Shaking off people like fleas off the back of a dog

Go ahead and dig our shelters, go ahead and build our dams
But when good Mother Earth starts lifting her skirts
I'm gonna pray for mercy no matter where I am
When the world goes rolling along
And the world goes rolling like a log
The world goes rolling, mmmhummm
Shaking off people like fleas off the back of a dog
