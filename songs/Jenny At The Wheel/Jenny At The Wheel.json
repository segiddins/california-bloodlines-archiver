    "Lyrics": "In Chicago the wind blows cold on the skin\nOf school girls waiting for a sign\nSomeday the fun, the California sun\nWill call from the end of the long yellow line\n\nAnd she calls on her friends and a few someday men\nShe is going for a ride\nIllinois rain will never be the same\nFor Jenny is getting out alive\n\nJenny at the wheel, she looks hard for the way\nOh, to the land of the sun\nJenny at the wheel and the far distant star\nThat, oh, she believes is the one\n\nNew Mexico fell in an adobe motel\nWith JC working on her car\nAnd she fell for his line she has heard many times\nFrom boys about to go to far\n\nShe is driving again with no money to spend\nAnd a card that shows her daddy's name\nShe believes any day that they'll show her the way\nTo the bright blazing sun of the Playa Del Rey\n\nJenny at the wheel, she looks hard for the way\nOh, to the land of the sun\nJenny at the wheel and the far distant star\nThat, oh, she believes is the one\n\nJenny at the wheel, she looks hard for the way\nOh, to the land of the sun\nJenny at the wheel and the far distant star\nThat, yeah, she believes is the one\n\n",
