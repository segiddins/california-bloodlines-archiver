In Chicago the wind blows cold on the skin
Of school girls waiting for a sign
Someday the fun, the California sun
Will call from the end of the long yellow line

And she calls on her friends and a few someday men
She is going for a ride
Illinois rain will never be the same
For Jenny is getting out alive

Jenny at the wheel, she looks hard for the way
Oh, to the land of the sun
Jenny at the wheel and the far distant star
That, oh, she believes is the one

New Mexico fell in an adobe motel
With JC working on her car
And she fell for his line she has heard many times
From boys about to go to far

She is driving again with no money to spend
And a card that shows her daddy's name
She believes any day that they'll show her the way
To the bright blazing sun of the Playa Del Rey

Jenny at the wheel, she looks hard for the way
Oh, to the land of the sun
Jenny at the wheel and the far distant star
That, oh, she believes is the one

Jenny at the wheel, she looks hard for the way
Oh, to the land of the sun
Jenny at the wheel and the far distant star
That, yeah, she believes is the one
