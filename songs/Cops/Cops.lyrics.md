Black and whiter, back street fighter
You're dirty or you're clean
Black and whiter, shotgun rider
Is there nothin' you ain't seen?

And you rule out on the highway
Rule out on the highway
Rule out on the highway

Magnum stroker, donut joker
You know Able and you know Cain
T.V. hero, school yard zero
You got to know, it's a knowin' game

And you rule out on the highway
Rule out on the highway
Rule out on the highway

Yea, we love you when we need you
And we hate you when we don't
You're the one who will
And I'm the one who won't

And you rule out on the highway
Rule out on the highway
Rule out on the highway
