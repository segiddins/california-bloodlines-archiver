Every time I see that Greyhound bus go rolling down the line
Makes me wish I'd talked much more to you when we had all that time
Still, it's only wishing and I know it's nothing more
So I'm never going back
Never going back
Never going back to Nashville anymore

Oklahoma City, yes, I know that she won't treat me cruel
Denver, Colorado, never made me feel like such a fool
But these are only cities
But they're cities without you
So I'm never going back
Never going back
Never going back to Nashville anymore

Still, it's only wishing and I know it's nothing more
So I'm never going back
Never going back
Never going back to Nashville anymore
