Oh, every time I see that Greyhound 
Bus go rolling down the line,
Makes me wish I'd talked much more to 
You when we had all that time. (E7)
(A) Still, it's only (B)wishing,
And I (E)know it's (G#m)nothing (C#m)more,
(E) Never goin´ (A)back,
(E) Never goin´ (A)back, no,
(E) Never goin´ (A)back, 
Oh, to (B)Nashville anymore.

(E) And Oklahoma City, yes, I know 
That she won't treat me cruel.
Denver, Colorado, never 
Made me feel like such a fool. (E7)
(A) These are only (B)cities,
But they're (E)cities (G#m)without (C#m)you,
(E) Never goin´ (A)back,
(E) Never goin´ (A)back, no,
(E) Never goin´ (A)back 
Oh, to (B)Nashville anymore.

(E) Never goin´ (A)back,
(E) Never goin´ (A)back 
Oh, to (B)Nashville anymore...
