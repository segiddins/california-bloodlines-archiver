Do you remember me
Turn back the years and see
Dance the distance
Dance it if you can
For as you'ld always say
Forever's just a day
Dance the distance
Dance it if you can

And far beyond the song
I've been searching far too long
I can't dance the distance by myself
And the sand where we would meet
Would vanish from my feet
I can't dance the distance by myself

If you should happen by
Like a soft wind on my mind
Dance the distance
Dance it if you can
You can look for me
Where the road turns to the sea
Dance the distance
Dance it if you can

And far beyond the song
I've been searching far too long
I can't dance the distance by myself
And the sand where we would meet
Would vanish from my feet
I can't dance the distance by myself

Do you remember me
Turn back the years and see
Dance the distance
Dance it if you can
For as you'ld always say
Forever's just a day
Let's dance the distance
Dance it while we can

Let's dance the distance
Dance it while we can

Let's dance the distance
Dance it while we can
