It's there in the light of the long forgotten
Running deep in the Milky Way
It's in the night of the prayer wheels turning
In the dawning of the day

It's in the names of the Christian martyrs
And the blood of the Jesus chain
It's in the flame of the fire starters
And the cave where the Crow man paints

It's revealed in the codes of the tombs of Cairo
Shining she rode through the crimson rain
I'll see you again in the grand reunion
And the prayers of the Mary chain

It's in the faith of young Saint Sebastian
He never cracked when the arrows flew
It's in the face in the Shroud of Turin
And the miracle of Guadalupe

It's in the field where the angels dance
to the rhythm of the hearts waiting for a chance
In the field where the angels dance
In the field where the angels dance

I'll take you away to the grand ballet
To the great holiday in the field
Was this all a dream
Just a moment in the stream
And what will we find in the field?

It's in the field where the angels dance
to the rhythm of the hearts waiting for a chance
In the field where the angels dance
In the field where the angels dance

It's in the field where the angels dance
to the rhythm of the hearts waiting for a chance
In the field where the angels dance
In the field where the angels dance

It's in the field where the angels dance
to the rhythm of the hearts waiting for a chance
In the field where the angels dance
In the field where the angels dance
