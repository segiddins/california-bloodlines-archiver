    "Lyrics": "It's there in the light of the long forgotten\nRunning deep in the Milky Way\nIt's in the night of the prayer wheels turning\nIn the dawning of the day\n\nIt's in the names of the Christian martyrs\nAnd the blood of the Jesus chain\nIt's in the flame of the fire starters\nAnd the cave where the Crow man paints\n\nIt's revealed in the codes of the tombs of Cairo\nShining she rode through the crimson rain\nI'll see you again in the grand reunion\nAnd the prayers of the Mary chain\n\nIt's in the faith of young Saint Sebastian\nHe never cracked when the arrows flew\nIt's in the face in the Shroud of Turin\nAnd the miracle of Guadalupe\n\nIt's in the field where the angels dance\nto the rhythm of the hearts waiting for a chance\nIn the field where the angels dance\nIn the field where the angels dance\n\nI'll take you away to the grand ballet\nTo the great holiday in the field\nWas this all a dream\nJust a moment in the stream\nAnd what will we find in the field?\n\nIt's in the field where the angels dance\nto the rhythm of the hearts waiting for a chance\nIn the field where the angels dance\nIn the field where the angels dance\n\nIt's in the field where the angels dance\nto the rhythm of the hearts waiting for a chance\nIn the field where the angels dance\nIn the field where the angels dance\n\nIt's in the field where the angels dance\nto the rhythm of the hearts waiting for a chance\nIn the field where the angels dance\nIn the field where the angels dance\n\n",
