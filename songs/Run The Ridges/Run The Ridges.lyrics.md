Well, I hope to tell you Johnny
That I lay that rifle down
But to leave the noose
And the calaboose
And I headed for another town
For another town yeah

Well, I’ve got your name in San Jose
And your picture’s there to see
And they’re shooting men in Texas
Just because they look like me
Just because they look like me

And we will run the ridges
Of our green land, Tennessee
And we will hide for forty years
If that’s what’s meant to be 
Meant to be, meant to be 
Meant to be, meant to be 
Meant to be, meant to be

Well, they’ll rope and tie you Johnny
And they’ll throw you to the ground
And they’ll let you hang a week or two
‘Fore they cut your body down
Body down, body down, body down
Body down, body down, body down

And we will run the ridges
Of our green land, Tennessee
And we will hide for forty years
If that’s what’s meant to be 
Meant to be, meant to be 
Meant to be, meant to be 
Meant to be, meant to be

 Well, I hope to tell you Johnny
That I lay that rifle down
But to leave the noose
And the calaboose
And headed for another town
For another town yeah
