I've taken all the good times
Put 'em in my pocket
Saved 'em for a rainy day
I'll be glad I got it
Put 'em in a trunk and lock it
Put 'em in a song and talk it
Gonna leave it in the music
And rock it in my own sweet time

Gonna leave it in the music and rock it in my own sweet time
Moving with the rhythm I'm never gonna leave behind
Leave it in the music and rock it in my own sweet time
This old guitar feels like loving that love of mine

San Francisco morning
You're lying close to me
I don't need a photograph
It's inside for me to see
'Cause I put it in a trunk and locked it
Put it in a song and talked it
Gonna leave it in the music
And rock it in my own sweet time

I'm gonna leave it in the music and rock it in my own sweet time
Moving with the rhythm I'm never gonna leave behind
Gonna leave it in the music and rock it in my own sweet time
This old guitar feels like loving that love of mine

Gonna leave it in the music and rock it in my own sweet time
Moving with the rhythm I'm never gonna leave behind
Leave it in the music and rock it in my own sweet time
This old guitar feels like loving that love of mine

Put it in a trunk and lock it
Put it in a song and talk it
Put it in a trunk and lock it
Put it in a song and talk it
