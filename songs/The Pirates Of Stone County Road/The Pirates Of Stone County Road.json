    "Lyrics": "It's a summer afternoon, somewhere in Kansas or Illinois or Oklahoma. The wind is blowing the leaves down the gutter as the mailman comes by.  \"Afternoon Mrs. Higgins, hot enough for ya?\"  Over on Stone County Road there's the smell of chicken frying\n\n\"Henry! It's getting t'wards suppertime you know. Henry!\"\n\nThere she calls from her second floor room\nThe end of a back porch afternoon\nWhere we'd stand on the bow of our own man-of-war\nNo longer the back porch any more\nAnd we'd sail pulling for China \nThe pirates of Stone County Road\nAll weathered and blown\nAnd we'd sail ever in glory \n'Till hungry and tired\nThe pirates of Stone County Road \nWere turning for home\n\n\"Henry! You better be getting on up to bed now, don't ya know, Henry!\"\n\nThere she calls from her high wicker chair\nAs I climb to my room up the stair\nWhere the wind through the shutters\nSends the mainsail to fall\nFrom the shadow of the bedpost on the wall\nAnd we'd sail pulling for China \nThe pirates of Stone County Road\nWeathered and blown\nAnd we'd sail ever in glory \n'Till hungry and tired\nThe pirates of Stone County Road \nWere turning for home\n\n\"Henry! Can you hear me, Henry. Are you up there Henry?  Henry!\"\n\n",
