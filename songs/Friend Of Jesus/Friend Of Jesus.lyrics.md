Jesus was a friend of John's
Jesus was a friend of Paul's
He was a friend of Matthew
James, John, down the line
I do believe I'd have been a friend
Of Jesus in his time

Jesus walked the streets at night
Jesus he didn't need a light
Jesus walked with the harlots
And he ran with the hoodlum kind
And I do believe I'd have been a friend
Of Jesus in his time

Jesus hung with the hard line gang
Jesus knew the songs they sang
He didn't have no money
I hear he didn't have a dime
I do believe I'd have been a friend
Of Jesus in his time
I do believe I'd have been a friend
Of Jesus in his time

Good God Almighty, my darling Jesus
You are a friend of mine
Come on along, we'll sing another song
Of Jesus in his prime

They caught him in the yard, the national guard
And Jesus, he was crucified
Open up the door, he's seen it all before
And Jesus, he is on your side

Good God Almighty, my darling Jesus
You are a friend of mine
You ought to know that He will walk you home 
Jesus, he's there by your side

Good God Almighty, my darling Jesus
You are a friend of mine
