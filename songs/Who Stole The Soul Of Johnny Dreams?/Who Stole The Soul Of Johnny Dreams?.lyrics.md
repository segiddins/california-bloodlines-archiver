Attention K Mart shoppers
Do you really need all of that crap?
Made somewhere in Thailand
No one's taking the rap
I'm holding out for yellow
Airbags in my shoes
I saw the ad from Calvin Klein
It's the kind the junkies use

Watching too much TV
When will I ever learn?
The call me the midnight surfer
'Cause I love to watch the channels turn
At 8 pm on Channel 2
"When Animals Attack" 
There's a lot of guys that I once knew
With monkeys on their backs

And written on the bathroom walls
That the old fan dancer cleans
Is the never answered question
Who stole the soul of Johnny Dreams? 

A singing dog named Peewee
Star of the neighborhood
Singing songs from Oklahoma
"Tutti Fruiti" is awfully good
Straight edged boy is cooking
Tofu for his friends
They're planning their next sit in
For the animals have friends

And written on the bathroom walls
That the old fan dancer cleans
Is the never answered question
Who stole the soul of Johnny Dreams? 

Still I'm a circus boy
They're taking up croquet
Someone stole a ferris wheel
From Fargo yesterday
I have no sense of who I am
Or who that I am not
Am I "The Great Wallenda"
That everyone forgot

Still I write the songs
That only I will sing
Something has gone wrong
It's the bell that never rings
Hip hop rappers and DJ's
Pop stars, lawyers and thieves
Someone's selling the rainbow
And things you wouldn't believe

And written on the bathroom walls
That the old fan dancer cleans
Is the never answered question
Who stole the soul of Johnny Dreams? 

And written on the bathroom walls
That the old fan dancer cleans
Is the never answered question
Who stole the soul of Johnny Dreams? 

Who stole the soul
Who stole the soul
Who stole the soul
Of Johnny Dreams?
