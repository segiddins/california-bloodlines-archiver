There was time for the laughter
And time for the rain
Time for the people
Who don’t know my name
And time for everything
I know that it’s true
And I know that I should have had 
More time for you

So lock all the windows
And close all the doors
And don’t let me go
Out running no more
Oh, lock all the windows
And close all the doors
And don’t let me go
Out running no more

And there’s so many places
That I’ve never been
So many faces
Are calling me friend
LA is pretty
New York is cold
Chicago is just
An old story I’ve told

So lock all the windows
And close all the doors
And don’t let me go
Out running no more
Oh lock all the windows
And close all the doors
And don’t let me go
Out running no more

And the hands on the clock
Keep on going around
And the calendar pages
Keep falling on down
 So come follow me
Then wherever we go
And when we’ll be home here
I really don’t know

So lock all the windows
And close all the doors
And don’t let me go
Out running no more
Oh lock all the windows
And close all the doors
And don’t let me go
Out running no more

So lock all the windows
And close all the doors
And we'll got out running
Just like before
