She's running through the cornfields of New York City
I'm driving by the cornfields of Illinois
I wonder how the dream feels in New York City
Same as the dream that I had in Illinois

She's skating on the backroads of Joplin Missouri
She's skating on the avenues of New York City too
How do the wheels sound in Joplin, Missouri
Same as the sweet singing wheels in New York do

And she shines like a diamond
To this runner in the night
I'm a cowboy in the distance
Waiting for the light

There's a girl who's in love in Joplin Missouri
There's a girl who's in love in New York just the same
In love with the boys out chasing their dreams
In love with a boy, and she hardly knows his name

There's a telephone that's ringing in Joplin Missouri
There's a telephone that's ringing in New York plain as day
Waiting for a call in New York in the city
Waiting for a call from the boy who went away

And she shines like a diamond
To this runner in the night
I'm a cowboy in the distance
Waiting for the light

She's running through the cornfields of New York City
I'm driving by the cornfields of Missouri it seems
I wonder if she knows there's a cowboy in the distance
I wonder if she knows that she's in the cowboy's dreams

And she shines like a diamond
To this runner in the night
I'm a cowboy in the distance
Just waiting for the light...
