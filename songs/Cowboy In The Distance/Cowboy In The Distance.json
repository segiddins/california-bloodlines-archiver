    "Lyrics": "She's running through the cornfields of New York City\nI'm driving by the cornfields of Illinois\nI wonder how the dream feels in New York City\nSame as the dream that I had in Illinois\n\nShe's skating on the backroads of Joplin Missouri\nShe's skating on the avenues of New York City too\nHow do the wheels sound in Joplin, Missouri\nSame as the sweet singing wheels in New York do\n\nAnd she shines like a diamond\nTo this runner in the night\nI'm a cowboy in the distance\nWaiting for the light\n\nThere's a girl who's in love in Joplin Missouri\nThere's a girl who's in love in New York just the same\nIn love with the boys out chasing their dreams\nIn love with a boy, and she hardly knows his name\n\nThere's a telephone that's ringing in Joplin Missouri\nThere's a telephone that's ringing in New York plain as day\nWaiting for a call in New York in the city\nWaiting for a call from the boy who went away\n\nAnd she shines like a diamond\nTo this runner in the night\nI'm a cowboy in the distance\nWaiting for the light\n\nShe's running through the cornfields of New York City\nI'm driving by the cornfields of Missouri it seems\nI wonder if she knows there's a cowboy in the distance\nI wonder if she knows that she's in the cowboy's dreams\n\nAnd she shines like a diamond\nTo this runner in the night\nI'm a cowboy in the distance\nJust waiting for the light...\n\n",
