Rally down the night
Earth has found the distant light
Risen voices come from dogs
Alive and mad as Godless love
Rally down the night

Rally down the night
Rising in the distant light
They have found a face on Mars
Messages from distant stars
Who will find the hidden clues
In 19 point five latitude
And I have seen the shining light
Still above me in the night
Yes it is still, it does not move
Behind the black door is the clue
Refracted light is known to bend
When seen through a camera lens
Rally down the night

I have seen the shining light

Rally down the night
Well I still seek the shining light
Spoken of by chosen few
Privileged by the holy view
That transforms souls of common thieves
And shatters what a man can see
A spiderâ€™s webs of lies believes
It is I who fly the pale balloon
And walks the dark side of the moon
And I stand naked in the night
For just one glimpse of lady light
The watchman's lantern's flag the train
For all the waiting, silence reigns
To realise the golden crane
Where one may taste the holy name
And dogs no longer feel the storm
on carefree roads on their way home

Rally down the night
Earth has moved the chance of light
