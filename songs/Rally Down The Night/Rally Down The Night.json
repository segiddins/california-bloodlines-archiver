    "Lyrics": "Rally down the night\nEarth has found the distant light\nRisen voices come from dogs\nAlive and mad as Godless love\nRally down the night\n\nRally down the night\nRising in the distant light\nThey have found a face on Mars\nMessages from distant stars\nWho will find the hidden clues\nIn 19 point five latitude\nAnd I have seen the shining light\nStill above me in the night\nYes it is still, it does not move\nBehind the black door is the clue\nRefracted light is known to bend\nWhen seen through a camera lens\nRally down the night\n\nI have seen the shining light\n\nRally down the night\nWell I still seek the shining light\nSpoken of by chosen few\nPrivileged by the holy view\nThat transforms souls of common thieves\nAnd shatters what a man can see\nA spider’s webs of lies believes\nIt is I who fly the pale balloon\nAnd walks the dark side of the moon\nAnd I stand naked in the night\nFor just one glimpse of lady light\nThe watchman's lantern's flag the train\nFor all the waiting, silence reigns\nTo realise the golden crane\nWhere one may taste the holy name\nAnd dogs no longer feel the storm\non carefree roads on their way home\n\nRally down the night\nEarth has moved the chance of light\n\n",
