Like it was a movie and I didn't get the part
Oh, looking at my life, like it was a movie
Like it was a rerun where you get another start

Looking at your life on the silver screen
And you know, it happens in the movies
Yeah, yeah, yeah, in the movies
Oh in the movies
It only happens in the movies

I was looking at my life, like it was a movie
Like it was a movie and I'm waiting for the cue
Oh, looking at my life, like it was a movie
Like they didn't choose me and there's nothing I could do
It happens in the movies, hey, hey, Jimmy Dean
Looking at your life on the silver screen
And you know, it happens in the movies
Yeah, yeah, yeah, in the movies
Oh in the movies
It only happens in the movies

Oh, let me find a new love, let her be the one love
Let her be a true love like it happens in the movies
