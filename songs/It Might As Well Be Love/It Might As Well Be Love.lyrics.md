It might as well be love
I’m one time down like I always was
It might as well be love
My heart’s gone mad like it always does

It might as well be true
I had a feeling that it might be you
It might as well be you+
You gotta love somebody and you know it’s true

Loving you
Dreams come true
Oooh
And hey, it might as well be love

Hey, it might as well be us
All I do is think about you since I saw you from the bus
Hey, it might as well be us
I’m one time down like I always was

Hey, it might as well be love
