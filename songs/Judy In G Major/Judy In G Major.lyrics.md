See how my Judy comes
Coming like the girl who never saw the light of day 
See how my Judy runs
Running in the arms of the boy who got away
And she prays for the light
To come back to her in the middle of the night
Well alright
She can pray when the morning comes

See how my Judy cries
Crying like the girl who never had the right of way
Oh, see how my Judy tries
Trying too hard with a heart that's breaking every day
And she prays for the light
To come back to her in the middle of the night
Well alright
She can pray when the morning comes

For a home, for a start
She can wait so long as a bullet in her heart
Well alright, she can pray when the morning
Well alright, she can pray when the morning
Well alright, she can pray when the morning comes

See how my Judy comes
Coming like the girl who never saw the light of day 
See how my Judy runs
Running in the arms of the boy who got away
And she prays for the light
To come back to her in the middle of the night
Well alright
She can pray when the morning comes

Yea, for a home, for a start
She can wait so long as a bullet in her heart
Well alright, she can pray when the morning
Well alright, she can pray when the morning
Well alright, she can pray when the morning comes
