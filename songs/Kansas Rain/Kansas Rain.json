    "Lyrics": "My oh my how the time does fly\nWanna make you lay right down and die\nOr be an eagle flying high\nSpinning circles in the sky\nHe must know the reason why\n\nBut there ain't no change in Kansas rain\nForever it falls out on the plain\nAnd the Phoenix sun like a clockwork run\nDay by day, one by one\nWe fall like candles in the sun\nGone are all the lonesome trains\nBut there ain't no change in Kansas rain\nThere ain't no change in Kansas rain, no, no\n\nStanding in line at the Bank of America\nNobody spoke, they were in the house of God\nAnd a church I know is a drive-in show\nAnd a local band plays hymns to go\n\"Jesus loves me\" rock and roll\n\nBut there ain't no change in Kansas rain\nForever it falls out on the plain\nAnd the Phoenix sun like a clockwork run\nDay by day, one by one\nWe fall like candles in the sun\nGone are all the lonesome trains\nBut there ain't no change in Kansas rain\nThere ain't no change in Kansas rain, no, no\n\nDay by day, one by one\nWe fall like candles in the sun\nGone are all the lonesome trains\nBut there ain't no change in Kansas rain\nThere ain't no change in Kansas rain, no, no\n\n",
