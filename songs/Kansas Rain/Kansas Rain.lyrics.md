My oh my how the time does fly
Wanna make you lay right down and die
Or be an eagle flying high
Spinning circles in the sky
He must know the reason why

But there ain't no change in Kansas rain
Forever it falls out on the plain
And the Phoenix sun like a clockwork run
Day by day, one by one
We fall like candles in the sun
Gone are all the lonesome trains
But there ain't no change in Kansas rain
There ain't no change in Kansas rain, no, no

Standing in line at the Bank of America
Nobody spoke, they were in the house of God
And a church I know is a drive-in show
And a local band plays hymns to go
"Jesus loves me" rock and roll

But there ain't no change in Kansas rain
Forever it falls out on the plain
And the Phoenix sun like a clockwork run
Day by day, one by one
We fall like candles in the sun
Gone are all the lonesome trains
But there ain't no change in Kansas rain
There ain't no change in Kansas rain, no, no

Day by day, one by one
We fall like candles in the sun
Gone are all the lonesome trains
But there ain't no change in Kansas rain
There ain't no change in Kansas rain, no, no
