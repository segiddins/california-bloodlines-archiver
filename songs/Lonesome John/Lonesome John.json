    "Lyrics": "You got to know how to hold a stogie\nKeeping it dry through the wind and the rain\nThen you move out along to California\nYou and me and the seasons change\nYou and me and the seasons change\n\nGonna learn to live, not learn to die\nI'm a-gonna lean like a willow on the sky\nI found a girl who yearns to lie\nWith a lonesome head on her lonesome thigh\nWith a lonesome head on her lonesome thigh\n\nI'm singing hee ah ha ha\nYou don't need words for a lonesome song\nHee ah ha ha\nIs there one more going home for you, lonesome John?\nJust one more going home for you, lonesome John?\n\nIt's been so long since I've seen Angel Rain\nThey no longer make that kind\nAll the colour's gone to the green hills, darling\nAll of my life I was colour-blind, I know it now\nAll of my life, I've been colour-blind\n\nI'm singing hee ah ha ha\nYou don't need words for a lonesome song\nHee ah ha ha\nIs there one more going home for you, lonesome John?\nJust one more going home for you, lonesome John?\n\n",
