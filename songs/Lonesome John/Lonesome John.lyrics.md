You got to know how to hold a stogie
Keeping it dry through the wind and the rain
Then you move out along to California
You and me and the seasons change
You and me and the seasons change

Gonna learn to live, not learn to die
I'm a-gonna lean like a willow on the sky
I found a girl who yearns to lie
With a lonesome head on her lonesome thigh
With a lonesome head on her lonesome thigh

I'm singing hee ah ha ha
You don't need words for a lonesome song
Hee ah ha ha
Is there one more going home for you, lonesome John?
Just one more going home for you, lonesome John?

It's been so long since I've seen Angel Rain
They no longer make that kind
All the colour's gone to the green hills, darling
All of my life I was colour-blind, I know it now
All of my life, I've been colour-blind

I'm singing hee ah ha ha
You don't need words for a lonesome song
Hee ah ha ha
Is there one more going home for you, lonesome John?
Just one more going home for you, lonesome John?
