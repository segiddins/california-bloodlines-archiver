    "Lyrics": "As I walk down the street I will stare at my feet\nSo I don't see the eyes of the homeless\nThen I run inside where I work, I can hide\nFor there I can deal with the heartless\n\nAnd earning my pay on a long working day\nI can hide in the heart of Saint Francis\nWhen gold is the king we are birds in the ring\nAnd we all are just taking our chances\n\nThe heartless, who will never see the light, \nAnd they think black is white\nAnd I hope some day they might\nFind their way back home\n\nAs I look in your eyes all I see are the lies\nI don't even know if you know them\nAre we paying the price for a handful of rice\nThat was thrown at the hearts who now own them\n\nWe're heartless, and we never see the light\nWhen we think black is white\nAnd I hope some day we might\nFind our way back home\n\nAs I walk down the street I will stare at my feet\nSo I don't see the eyes in the cold space\nAnd I will take all the hurt and be rolled like a shirt\nIn the back of my heart it can hide there\n\nThe heartless, who will never see the light\nAnd they think black is white\nAnd I hope some day they might\nFind that way back home\n\n",
