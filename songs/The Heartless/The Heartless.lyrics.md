As I walk down the street I will stare at my feet
So I don't see the eyes of the homeless
Then I run inside where I work, I can hide
For there I can deal with the heartless

And earning my pay on a long working day
I can hide in the heart of Saint Francis
When gold is the king we are birds in the ring
And we all are just taking our chances

The heartless, who will never see the light, 
And they think black is white
And I hope some day they might
Find their way back home

As I look in your eyes all I see are the lies
I don't even know if you know them
Are we paying the price for a handful of rice
That was thrown at the hearts who now own them

We're heartless, and we never see the light
When we think black is white
And I hope some day we might
Find our way back home

As I walk down the street I will stare at my feet
So I don't see the eyes in the cold space
And I will take all the hurt and be rolled like a shirt
In the back of my heart it can hide there

The heartless, who will never see the light
And they think black is white
And I hope some day they might
Find that way back home
