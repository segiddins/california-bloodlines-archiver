Out among the stars when the night was ours
True love in the burned out cars
Out among the stars when the night was ours
Oh, we were dreaming in the honky tonk bars

Out among the night where our hearts had flight
Once in love and I'm feeling alright
Out among the night where our hearts had flight
Oh, we were getting home when the morning gets light

The high that you're in when the moon does spin
Loving is the gold at the rainbow's end
The high that you're in when the moon does spin
Going too far when the night was ours 

Out among the stars when the night was ours
True love in the burned out cars
Out among the stars when the night was ours
Oh, we were dreaming in the honky tonk bars

The high that you're in when the moon does spin
Loving is the gold at the rainbow's end
The high that you're in when the moon does spin
Going too far when the night was ours 

Out among the stars when the night was ours
Out among the stars when the night was ours
Out among the stars when the night was ours
