It ain't the gold
That keeps you on the highway in the cold
It ain't the gold
That keeps your wheels a-turning when you're old
It's not the end, it's the beginning
Here's to Errol Flynning
It is the winning
It ain't the gold

It ain't the fame
That keeps you on the highway in the rain
It ain't the fame
That keeps the warhorse playing in the game
It's not the end, it's the beginning
Not the fall, it is the pinning
It is the winning
It ain't the gold

It's not the end, it's the beginning
And here's to Errol Flynning
It is the winning
It ain't the gold

It ain't the gold
