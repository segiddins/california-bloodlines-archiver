We travel there\nWe travel everywhere\nWe go by air. We go by rail\nAnyplace they'll pay us scale\nNow, repeat the chorus\nHere we go\n\nWe're coming from the mountains\nCrossing o'er the plains\nIt's off to California\nAnd back again to Maine\nSing a song that you all know\nAnd let your voices go\nWe'll sing it out, my brothers\nWherever we may go\n\nThe folk group has a banjo\nBecause it's really in\nI'll let you hear my banjo ring\nWhen I learn to play the thing\nNow, repeat the chorus\nHere we go\n\nWe're coming from the mountains\nCrossing o'er the plains\nIt's off to California\nAnd back again to Maine\nSing a song that you all know\nAnd let your voices go\nWe'll sing it out, my brothers\nWherever we may go\n\nThe boys with Davy Crockett\nWho died at the Alamo\nWe heard them say when they attacked,\n\"I knew this room would kill the act\"\nNow, repeat the chorus\nHere we go\n\nWe're coming from the mountains\nCrossing o'er the plains\nIt's off to California\nAnd back again to Maine\nSing a song that you all know\nAnd let your voices go\nWe'll sing it out, my brothers\nWherever we may go\n\nComing from the mountains\nCrossing o'er the plains\nIt's off to California\nAnd back again to Maine\nSing a song that you all know\nAnd let your voices go\nWe'll sing it out, my brothers\nWherever we may go\n\n",
