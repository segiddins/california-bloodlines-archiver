We're coming from the mountains
Crossing o'er the plains
It's off to California
And back again to Maine
Sing a song that you all know
And let your voices go
We'll sing it out, my brothers
Wherever we may go

We travel here. We travel there
We travel everywhere
We go by air. We go by rail
Anyplace they'll pay us scale
Now, repeat the chorus
Here we go

We're coming from the mountains
Crossing o'er the plains
It's off to California
And back again to Maine
Sing a song that you all know
And let your voices go
We'll sing it out, my brothers
Wherever we may go

The folk group has a banjo
Because it's really in
I'll let you hear my banjo ring
When I learn to play the thing
Now, repeat the chorus
Here we go

We're coming from the mountains
Crossing o'er the plains
It's off to California
And back again to Maine
Sing a song that you all know
And let your voices go
We'll sing it out, my brothers
Wherever we may go

The boys with Davy Crockett
Who died at the Alamo
We heard them say when they attacked,
"I knew this room would kill the act"
Now, repeat the chorus
Here we go

We're coming from the mountains
Crossing o'er the plains
It's off to California
And back again to Maine
Sing a song that you all know
And let your voices go
We'll sing it out, my brothers
Wherever we may go

Coming from the mountains
Crossing o'er the plains
It's off to California
And back again to Maine
Sing a song that you all know
And let your voices go
We'll sing it out, my brothers
Wherever we may go
