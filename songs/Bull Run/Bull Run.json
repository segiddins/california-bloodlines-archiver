    "Lyrics": "They was rallyin' in Washington in 1861\nThe Civil War had started and the fighting just begun\nA general named McDowell thought he'd win the war one day\nSo he took his chicken hearted boys to old Virgin-eye-a\n\nHe told his men at Centerville at the turnpike out of town\nIt's here we're gonna pitch our tents a perfect camping ground\nBut, little did the general know upon a yonder hill\nThem rebels was a sittin' and a waitin' for the kill\nAh ha ha ha\n\nThey went rippin' down the road just as fast as they could go\nAnd the Johnny Rebs behind them findin' rocks that they could throw\nA laughin' and a yellin' for as far as they could see\nThem blue coats were a headin' back to Washington, DC\n\nGeneral Pierre Gustant Cooley Beauregard\nWas sittin' at the Henry house relaxin' in the yard\nAnd takin' life real easy eatin' on some apple pie\nWatchin' Yankee movements by their dust cloud in the sky\n(Ah, how bout another mint julep boy)\n\nA company of Yankees caught some rebels unaware\nStarted giving chase but them rebels didn't care\nCause they led 'em in a trap to a place they called Bull Run\nThem Yankee boys was headed into Stonewall Jackson's guns\n\nThey went rippin' down the road just as fast as they could go\nAnd the Johnny Rebs behind them findin' rocks that they could throw\nA laughin' and a yellin' for as far as they could see\nThem blue coats were a headin' back to Washington, DC\n\nThem cannon balls was flyin' round, can hear their thunder still\nWhen the Yankees lit there raid on top of Ol' Baldy Hill\nThe smoke there grew so thick they were shootin' their own men\nAlong came Ol' Jeb Stuart and he shot 'em once again\n(eeeeeeehaa)\n\nThey went rippin' down the road just as fast as they could go\nAnd the Johnny Rebs behind them findin' rocks that they could throw\nA laughin' and a yellin' for as far as they could see\nThem blue coats were a headin' back to Washington, DC\n\n\"Save your Confederate money boys. The South shall rise again\"\n\n",
