They was rallyin' in Washington in 1861
The Civil War had started and the fighting just begun
A general named McDowell thought he'd win the war one day
So he took his chicken hearted boys to old Virgin-eye-a

He told his men at Centerville at the turnpike out of town
It's here we're gonna pitch our tents a perfect camping ground
But, little did the general know upon a yonder hill
Them rebels was a sittin' and a waitin' for the kill
Ah ha ha ha

They went rippin' down the road just as fast as they could go
And the Johnny Rebs behind them findin' rocks that they could throw
A laughin' and a yellin' for as far as they could see
Them blue coats were a headin' back to Washington, DC

General Pierre Gustant Cooley Beauregard
Was sittin' at the Henry house relaxin' in the yard
And takin' life real easy eatin' on some apple pie
Watchin' Yankee movements by their dust cloud in the sky
(Ah, how bout another mint julep boy)

A company of Yankees caught some rebels unaware
Started giving chase but them rebels didn't care
Cause they led 'em in a trap to a place they called Bull Run
Them Yankee boys was headed into Stonewall Jackson's guns

They went rippin' down the road just as fast as they could go
And the Johnny Rebs behind them findin' rocks that they could throw
A laughin' and a yellin' for as far as they could see
Them blue coats were a headin' back to Washington, DC

Them cannon balls was flyin' round, can hear their thunder still
When the Yankees lit there raid on top of Ol' Baldy Hill
The smoke there grew so thick they were shootin' their own men
Along came Ol' Jeb Stuart and he shot 'em once again
(eeeeeeehaa)

They went rippin' down the road just as fast as they could go
And the Johnny Rebs behind them findin' rocks that they could throw
A laughin' and a yellin' for as far as they could see
Them blue coats were a headin' back to Washington, DC

"Save your Confederate money boys. The South shall rise again"
